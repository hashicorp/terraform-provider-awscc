# awscc_codestarconnections_connection (Resource)

Schema for AWS::CodeStarConnections::Connection resource which can be used to connect external source providers with AWS CodePipeline

## Example Usage

### GitHub CodeStar Connection Setup

Creates an AWS CodeStar connection to GitHub that enables integration between AWS services and GitHub repositories, requiring manual authorization after creation.

~> This example is generated by LLM using Amazon Bedrock and validated using terraform validate, apply and destroy. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date. We recommend independently verifying the content.

```terraform
# Create the CodeStar connection
resource "awscc_codestarconnections_connection" "example" {
  connection_name = "github-connection-example"
  provider_type   = "GitHub"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

# Output useful information
output "connection_arn" {
  value = awscc_codestarconnections_connection.example.connection_arn
}

output "connection_status" {
  value = awscc_codestarconnections_connection.example.connection_status
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `connection_name` (String) The name of the connection. Connection names must be unique in an AWS user account.

### Optional

- `host_arn` (String) The host arn configured to represent the infrastructure where your third-party provider is installed. You must specify either a ProviderType or a HostArn.
- `provider_type` (String) The name of the external provider where your third-party code repository is configured. You must specify either a ProviderType or a HostArn.
- `tags` (Attributes List) Specifies the tags applied to a connection. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))

### Read-Only

- `connection_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  connection. The ARN is used as the connection reference when the connection is shared between AWS services.
- `connection_status` (String) The current status of the connection.
- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `owner_account_id` (String) The name of the external provider where your third-party code repository is configured. For Bitbucket, this is the account ID of the owner of the Bitbucket repository.

### Nested Schema for `tags`

Optional:

- `key` (String) The key name of the tag. You can specify a value that is 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length and cannot be prefixed with aws:. You can use any of the following characters: the set of Unicode letters, digits, whitespace, _, ., /, =, +, and -.
- `value` (String) The value for the tag. You can specify a value that is 0 to 256 Unicode characters in length and cannot be prefixed with aws:. You can use any of the following characters: the set of Unicode letters, digits, whitespace, _, ., /, =, +, and -.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_codestarconnections_connection.example
  identity = {
    connection_arn = "connection_arn"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `connection_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  connection

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The ID of the AWS account
- `region` (String) The AWS region where the resource is located

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_codestarconnections_connection.example
  id = "connection_arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_codestarconnections_connection.example "connection_arn"
```
