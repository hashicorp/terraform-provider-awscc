# awscc_codestarconnections_connection (Resource)

Schema for AWS::CodeStarConnections::Connection resource which can be used to connect external source providers with AWS CodePipeline

## Example Usage

### GitHub CodeStar Connection Setup

Creates an AWS CodeStar connection to GitHub that enables integration between AWS services and GitHub repositories, requiring manual authorization after creation.

~> This example is generated by LLM using Amazon Bedrock and validated using terraform validate, apply and destroy. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date. We recommend independently verifying the content.

```terraform
# Create the CodeStar connection
resource "awscc_codestarconnections_connection" "example" {
  connection_name = "github-connection-example"
  provider_type   = "GitHub"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

# Output useful information
output "connection_arn" {
  value = awscc_codestarconnections_connection.example.connection_arn
}

output "connection_status" {
  value = awscc_codestarconnections_connection.example.connection_status
}
```
