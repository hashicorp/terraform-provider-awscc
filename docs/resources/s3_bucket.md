# awscc_s3_bucket (Resource)

The ``AWS::S3::Bucket`` resource creates an Amazon S3 bucket in the same AWS Region where you create the AWS CloudFormation stack.
 To control how AWS CloudFormation handles the bucket when the stack is deleted, you can set a deletion policy for your bucket. You can choose to *retain* the bucket or to *delete* the bucket. For more information, see [DeletionPolicy Attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-deletionpolicy.html).
  You can only delete empty buckets. Deletion fails for buckets that have contents.
## Example Usage

## Schema

### Optional

- `accelerate_configuration` (Attributes) Configures the transfer acceleration state for an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see [Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--accelerate_configuration))
- `access_control` (String) This is a legacy property, and it is not recommended for most use cases. A majority of modern use cases in Amazon S3 no longer require the use of ACLs, and we recommend that you keep ACLs disabled. For more information, see [Controlling object ownership](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
  A canned access control list (ACL) that grants predefined permissions to the bucket. For more information about canned ACLs, see [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
  S3 buckets are created with ACLs disabled by default. Therefore, unless you explicitly set the [AWS::S3::OwnershipControls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-bucket-ownershipcontrols.html) property to enable ACLs, your resource will fail to deploy with any value other than Private. Use cases requiring ACLs are uncommon.
  The majority of access control configurations can be successfully and more easily achieved with bucket policies. For more information, see [AWS::S3::BucketPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-policy.html). For examples of common policy configurations, including S3 Server Access Logs buckets and more, see [Bucket policy examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

### Nested Schema for `public_access_block_configuration`

Optional:

- `block_public_acls` (Boolean) Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public access control lists (ACLs) for this bucket and objects in this bucket. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` causes the following behavior:
  +  PUT Bucket ACL and PUT Object ACL calls fail if the specified ACL is public.
  +  PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.
  +  PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.
  
 Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.
- `block_public_policy` (Boolean) Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies for this bucket. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the specified bucket policy allows public access. 
 Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.
- `ignore_public_acls` (Boolean) Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for this bucket and objects in this bucket. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` causes Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs on this bucket and objects in this bucket.
 Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any existing ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set.
- `restrict_public_buckets` (Boolean) Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket policies for this bucket. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` restricts access to this bucket to only AWS-service principals and authorized users within this account if the bucket has a public policy.

- `status` (String) Specifies whether the rule is enabled.

Optional:

- `delete_marker_replication` (Attributes) Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates delete markers. If you specify a ``Filter`` in your replication configuration, you must also include a ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` element. If your ``Filter`` includes a ``Tag`` element, the ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` ``Status`` must be set to Disabled, because Amazon S3 does not support replicating delete markers for tag-based rules. For an example configuration, see [Basic Rule Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-config-min-rule-config). 
 For more information about delete marker replication, see [Basic Rule Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/delete-marker-replication.html). 
  If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication of delete markers differently. For more information, see [Backward Compatibility](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-backward-compat-considerations). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--replication_configuration--rules--delete_marker_replication))
- `filter` (Attributes) A filter that identifies the subset of objects to which the replication rule applies. A ``Filter`` must specify exactly one ``Prefix``, ``TagFilter``, or an ``And`` child element. The use of the filter field indicates that this is a V2 replication configuration. This field isn't supported in a V1 replication configuration.
  V1 replication configuration only supports filtering by key prefix. To filter using a V1 replication configuration, add the ``Prefix`` directly as a child element of the ``Rule`` element. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--replication_configuration--rules--filter))
- `id` (String) A unique identifier for the rule. The maximum value is 255 characters. If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation generates a random ID. When using a V2 replication configuration this property is capitalized as "ID".
- `prefix` (String) An object key name prefix that identifies the object or objects to which the rule applies. The maximum prefix length is 1,024 characters. To include all objects in a bucket, specify an empty string. To filter using a V1 replication configuration, add the ``Prefix`` directly as a child element of the ``Rule`` element.
  Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML requests. For more information, see [XML related object key constraints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints).
- `priority` (Number) The priority indicates which rule has precedence whenever two or more replication rules conflict. Amazon S3 will attempt to replicate objects according to all replication rules. However, if there are two or more rules with the same destination bucket, then objects will be replicated according to the rule with the highest priority. The higher the number, the higher the priority. 
 For more information, see [Replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
- `source_selection_criteria` (Attributes) A container that describes additional filters for identifying the source objects that you want to replicate.

Optional:

- `access_control_translation` (Attributes) Specify this only in a cross-account scenario (where source and destination bucket owners are not the same), and you want to change replica ownership to the AWS-account that owns the destination bucket. If this is not specified in the replication configuration, the replicas are owned by same AWS-account that owns the source object. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--replication_configuration--rules--destination--access_control_translation))
- `account` (String) Destination bucket owner account ID. In a cross-account scenario, if you direct Amazon S3 to change replica ownership to the AWS-account that owns the destination bucket by specifying the ``AccessControlTranslation`` property, this is the account ID of the destination bucket owner. For more information, see [Cross-Region Replication Additional Configuration: Change Replica Owner](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/crr-change-owner.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
 If you specify the ``AccessControlTranslation`` property, the ``Account`` property is required.

Must be specified together with a ``Metrics`` block. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--replication_configuration--rules--destination--replication_time))
- `storage_class` (String) The storage class to use when replicating objects, such as S3 Standard or reduced redundancy. By default, Amazon S3 uses the storage class of the source object to create the object replica. 
 For valid values, see the ``StorageClass`` element of the [PUT Bucket replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTreplication.html) action in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

### Nested Schema for `website_configuration.redirect_all_requests_to`

Required:

- `host_name` (String) Name of the host where requests are redirected.

Optional:

- `protocol` (String) Protocol to use when redirecting requests. The default is the protocol that is used in the original request.

### Nested Schema for `website_configuration.routing_rules`

Required:

- `redirect_rule` (Attributes) Container for redirect information. You can redirect requests to another host, to another page, or with another protocol. In the event of an error, you can specify a different error code to return. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--website_configuration--routing_rules--redirect_rule))

Optional:

- `routing_rule_condition` (Attributes) A container for describing a condition that must be met for the specified redirect to apply. For example, 1. If request is for pages in the ``/docs`` folder, redirect to the ``/documents`` folder. 2. If request results in HTTP error 4xx, redirect request to another host where you might process the error. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--website_configuration--routing_rules--routing_rule_condition))

### Nested Schema for `website_configuration.routing_rules.redirect_rule`

Optional:

- `host_name` (String) The host name to use in the redirect request.
- `http_redirect_code` (String) The HTTP redirect code to use on the response. Not required if one of the siblings is present.
- `protocol` (String) Protocol to use when redirecting requests. The default is the protocol that is used in the original request.
- `replace_key_prefix_with` (String) The object key prefix to use in the redirect request. For example, to redirect requests for all pages with prefix ``docs/`` (objects in the ``docs/`` folder) to ``documents/``, you can set a condition block with ``KeyPrefixEquals`` set to ``docs/`` and in the Redirect set ``ReplaceKeyPrefixWith`` to ``/documents``. Not required if one of the siblings is present. Can be present only if ``ReplaceKeyWith`` is not provided.
  Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML requests. For more information, see [XML related object key constraints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints).
- `replace_key_with` (String) The specific object key to use in the redirect request. For example, redirect request to ``error.html``. Not required if one of the siblings is present. Can be present only if ``ReplaceKeyPrefixWith`` is not provided.
  Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML requests. For more information, see [XML related object key constraints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints).

### Nested Schema for `website_configuration.routing_rules.routing_rule_condition`

Optional:

- `http_error_code_returned_equals` (String) The HTTP error code when the redirect is applied. In the event of an error, if the error code equals this value, then the specified redirect is applied.
 Required when parent element ``Condition`` is specified and sibling ``KeyPrefixEquals`` is not specified. If both are specified, then both must be true for the redirect to be applied.
- `key_prefix_equals` (String) The object key name prefix when the redirect is applied. For example, to redirect requests for ``ExamplePage.html``, the key prefix will be ``ExamplePage.html``. To redirect request for all pages with the prefix ``docs/``, the key prefix will be ``/docs``, which identifies all objects in the docs/ folder.
 Required when the parent element ``Condition`` is specified and sibling ``HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals`` is not specified. If both conditions are specified, both must be true for the redirect to be applied.
