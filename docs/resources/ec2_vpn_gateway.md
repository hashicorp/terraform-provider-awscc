# awscc_ec2_vpn_gateway (Resource)

Specifies a virtual private gateway. A virtual private gateway is the endpoint on the VPC side of your VPN connection. You can create a virtual private gateway before creating the VPC itself.
 For more information, see [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html) in the *User Guide*.

## Example Usage

### First example - create basic VPN gateway

```terraform
resource "awscc_ec2_vpn_gateway" "example_vpn_gateway" {
  type = "ipsec.1"
  tags = [
    {
      key   = "Name"
      value = "Example VPN Gateway"
    },
    {
      key   = "Modified By"
      value = "AWSCC"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Second example - create VPN specifying the private Autonomous System Number (ASN) for the Amazon side of a BGP session

```terraform
resource "awscc_ec2_vpn_gateway" "example_vpn_gateway" {
  type            = "ipsec.1"
  amazon_side_asn = 64512
  tags = [
    {
      key   = "Name"
      value = "Example VPN Gateway"
    },
    {
      key   = "Modified By"
      value = "AWSCC"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `value` (String) The tag value.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_vpn_gateway.example
  identity = {
    vpn_gateway_id = "vpn_gateway_id"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `vpn_gateway_id` (String)

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The ID of the AWS account
- `region` (String) The AWS region where the resource is located

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_vpn_gateway.example
  id = "vpn_gateway_id"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_ec2_vpn_gateway.example "vpn_gateway_id"
```
