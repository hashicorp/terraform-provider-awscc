# awscc_apigateway_usage_plan (Resource)

The ``AWS::ApiGateway::UsagePlan`` resource creates a usage plan for deployed APIs. A usage plan sets a target for the throttling and quota limits on individual client API keys. For more information, see [Creating and Using API Usage Plans in Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-api-usage-plans.html) in the *API Gateway Developer Guide*.
 In some cases clients can exceed the targets that you set. Don?t rely on usage plans to control costs. Consider using [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-managing-costs.html) to monitor costs and [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html) to manage API requests.

## Example Usage

### Usage Plan
Creates a usage plan for deployed APIs. A usage plan sets a target for the throttling and quota limits on individual client API keys.
```terraform
resource "awscc_apigateway_usage_plan" "example" {
  usage_plan_name = "Plan_dev"
  description     = "Dev usage plan"

  api_stages = [{
    api_id = awscc_apigateway_rest_api.example.id
    stage  = awscc_apigateway_stage.example.stage_name
  }]

  quota = {
    limit  = 20
    offset = 2
    period = "WEEK"
  }

  throttle = {
    burst_limit = 5
    rate_limit  = 10
  }
}

resource "awscc_apigateway_stage" "example" {
  rest_api_id   = awscc_apigateway_rest_api.example.id
  deployment_id = awscc_apigateway_deployment.example.deployment_id
  stage_name    = "dev"
}

resource "awscc_apigateway_deployment" "example" {
  description = "Example Deployment"
  rest_api_id = awscc_apigateway_rest_api.example.id
}

resource "awscc_apigateway_rest_api" "example" {
  body = jsonencode({
    openapi = "3.0.1"
    info = {
      title   = "example"
      version = "1.0"
    }
    paths = {
      "/example" = {
        get = {
          x-amazon-apigateway-integration = {
            httpMethod           = "GET"
            payloadFormatVersion = "1.0"
            type                 = "HTTP_PROXY"
            uri                  = "https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  })

  name = "example"

  endpoint_configuration = {
    types = ["REGIONAL"]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `api_stages` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--api_stages))
- `description` (String)
- `quota` (Attributes) ``QuotaSettings`` is a property of the [AWS::ApiGateway::UsagePlan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-usageplan.html) resource that specifies a target for the maximum number of requests users can make to your REST APIs.
 In some cases clients can exceed the targets that you set. Don?t rely on usage plans to control costs. Consider using [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-managing-costs.html) to monitor costs and [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html) to manage API requests. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--quota))
- `tags` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
- `throttle` (Attributes) ``ThrottleSettings`` is a property of the [AWS::ApiGateway::UsagePlan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-usageplan.html) resource that specifies the overall request rate (average requests per second) and burst capacity when users call your REST APIs. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--throttle))
- `usage_plan_name` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_apigateway_usage_plan.example
  id = "id"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_apigateway_usage_plan.example "id"
```
