# awscc_apigateway_usage_plan (Resource)

The ``AWS::ApiGateway::UsagePlan`` resource creates a usage plan for deployed APIs. A usage plan sets a target for the throttling and quota limits on individual client API keys. For more information, see [Creating and Using API Usage Plans in Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-api-usage-plans.html) in the *API Gateway Developer Guide*.
 In some cases clients can exceed the targets that you set. Don?t rely on usage plans to control costs. Consider using [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-managing-costs.html) to monitor costs and [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html) to manage API requests.

## Example Usage

### Usage Plan
Creates a usage plan for deployed APIs. A usage plan sets a target for the throttling and quota limits on individual client API keys.
```terraform
resource "awscc_apigateway_usage_plan" "example" {
  usage_plan_name = "Plan_dev"
  description     = "Dev usage plan"

  api_stages = [{
    api_id = awscc_apigateway_rest_api.example.id
    stage  = awscc_apigateway_stage.example.stage_name
  }]

  quota = {
    limit  = 20
    offset = 2
    period = "WEEK"
  }

  throttle = {
    burst_limit = 5
    rate_limit  = 10
  }
}

resource "awscc_apigateway_stage" "example" {
  rest_api_id   = awscc_apigateway_rest_api.example.id
  deployment_id = awscc_apigateway_deployment.example.deployment_id
  stage_name    = "dev"
}

resource "awscc_apigateway_deployment" "example" {
  description = "Example Deployment"
  rest_api_id = awscc_apigateway_rest_api.example.id
}

resource "awscc_apigateway_rest_api" "example" {
  body = jsonencode({
    openapi = "3.0.1"
    info = {
      title   = "example"
      version = "1.0"
    }
    paths = {
      "/example" = {
        get = {
          x-amazon-apigateway-integration = {
            httpMethod           = "GET"
            payloadFormatVersion = "1.0"
            type                 = "HTTP_PROXY"
            uri                  = "https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  })

  name = "example"

  endpoint_configuration = {
    types = ["REGIONAL"]
  }
}
