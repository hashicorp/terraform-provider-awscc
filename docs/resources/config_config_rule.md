  Adds or updates an CC rule to evaluate if your AWS resources comply with your desired configurations. For information on how many CC rules you can have per account, see Service Limits https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/configlimits.html in the Developer Guide.
  There are two types of rules: Managed Rules and Custom Rules. You can use the ConfigRule resource to create both CC Managed Rules and CC Custom Rules.
  CC Managed Rules are predefined, customizable rules created by CC. For a list of managed rules, see List of Managed Rules https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html. If you are adding an CC managed rule, you must specify the rule's identifier for the SourceIdentifier key.
  CC Custom Rules are rules that you create from scratch. There are two ways to create CC custom rules: with Lambda functions (Developer Guide https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/gettingstarted-concepts.html#gettingstarted-concepts-function) and with CFNGUARDshort (Guard GitHub Repository https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard), a policy-as-code language. CC custom rules created with LAMlong are called Custom Lambda Rules and CC custom rules created with CFNGUARDshort are called Custom Policy Rules.
  If you are adding a new CC Custom LAM rule, you first need to create an LAMlong function that the rule invokes to evaluate your resources. When you use the ConfigRule resource to add a Custom LAM rule to CC, you must specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that LAMlong assigns to the function. You specify the ARN in the SourceIdentifier key. This key is part of the Source object, which is part of the ConfigRule object.
  For any new CC rule that you add, specify the ConfigRuleName in the ConfigRule object. Do not specify the ConfigRuleArn or the ConfigRuleId. These values are generated by CC for new rules.
  If you are updating a rule that you added previously, you can specify the rule by ConfigRuleName, ConfigRuleId, or ConfigRuleArn in the ConfigRule data type that you use in this request.
  For more information about developing and using CC rules, see Evaluating Resources with Rules https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config.html in the Developer Guide.

# awscc_config_config_rule (Resource)

You must first create and start the CC configuration recorder in order to create CC managed rules with CFNlong. For more information, see [Managing the Configuration Recorder](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/stop-start-recorder.html).
  Adds or updates an CC rule to evaluate if your AWS resources comply with your desired configurations. For information on how many CC rules you can have per account, see [Service Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/configlimits.html) in the *Developer Guide*.
 There are two types of rules: *Managed Rules* and *Custom Rules*. You can use the ``ConfigRule`` resource to create both CC Managed Rules and CC Custom Rules.
  CC Managed Rules are predefined, customizable rules created by CC. For a list of managed rules, see [List of Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html). If you are adding an CC managed rule, you must specify the rule's identifier for the ``SourceIdentifier`` key.
  CC Custom Rules are rules that you create from scratch. There are two ways to create CC custom rules: with Lambda functions ([Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/gettingstarted-concepts.html#gettingstarted-concepts-function)) and with CFNGUARDshort ([Guard GitHub Repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard)), a policy-as-code language. CC custom rules created with LAMlong are called *Custom Lambda Rules* and CC custom rules created with CFNGUARDshort are called *Custom Policy Rules*.
 If you are adding a new CC Custom LAM rule, you first need to create an LAMlong function that the rule invokes to evaluate your resources. When you use the ``ConfigRule`` resource to add a Custom LAM rule to CC, you must specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that LAMlong assigns to the function. You specify the ARN in the ``SourceIdentifier`` key. This key is part of the ``Source`` object, which is part of the ``ConfigRule`` object. 
 For any new CC rule that you add, specify the ``ConfigRuleName`` in the ``ConfigRule`` object. Do not specify the ``ConfigRuleArn`` or the ``ConfigRuleId``. These values are generated by CC for new rules.
 If you are updating a rule that you added previously, you can specify the rule by ``ConfigRuleName``, ``ConfigRuleId``, or ``ConfigRuleArn`` in the ``ConfigRule`` data type that you use in this request.
 For more information about developing and using CC rules, see [Evaluating Resources with Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config.html) in the *Developer Guide*.
## Example Usage

### Create a Managed Config Rule 
To create a Config rule
```terraform
resource "awscc_config_config_rule" "example" {
  config_rule_name = "S3_bucket_versioning_enabled"
  description      = "Rule to validate if S3 Bucket versioning is enabled"
  evaluation_modes = [{
    mode = "DETECTIVE"
  }]

  source = {
    owner             = "AWS"
    source_identifier = "S3_BUCKET_VERSIONING_ENABLED"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `source` (Attributes) Provides the rule owner (```` for managed rules, ``CUSTOM_POLICY`` for Custom Policy rules, and ``CUSTOM_LAMBDA`` for Custom Lambda rules), the rule identifier, and the notifications that cause the function to evaluate your AWS resources. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--source))

### Optional

- `compliance` (Attributes) Indicates whether an AWS resource or CC rule is compliant and provides the number of contributors that affect the compliance. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--compliance))
- `config_rule_name` (String) A name for the CC rule. If you don't specify a name, CFN generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the rule name. For more information, see [Name Type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-name.html).
- `description` (String) The description that you provide for the CC rule.
- `evaluation_modes` (Attributes List) The modes the CC rule can be evaluated in. The valid values are distinct objects. By default, the value is Detective evaluation mode only. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--evaluation_modes))
- `input_parameters` (String) A string, in JSON format, that is passed to the CC rule Lambda function.
- `maximum_execution_frequency` (String) The maximum frequency with which CC runs evaluations for a rule. You can specify a value for ``MaximumExecutionFrequency`` when:
  +  You are using an AWS managed rule that is triggered at a periodic frequency.
  +  Your custom rule is triggered when CC delivers the configuration snapshot. For more information, see [ConfigSnapshotDeliveryProperties](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_ConfigSnapshotDeliveryProperties.html).
  
  By default, rules with a periodic trigger are evaluated every 24 hours. To change the frequency, specify a valid value for the ``MaximumExecutionFrequency`` parameter.
- `scope` (Attributes) Defines which resources can trigger an evaluation for the rule. The scope can include one or more resource types, a combination of one resource type and one resource ID, or a combination of a tag key and value. Specify a scope to constrain the resources that can trigger an evaluation for the rule. If you do not specify a scope, evaluations are triggered when any resource in the recording group changes.
  The scope can be empty. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--scope))

### Read-Only

- `arn` (String)
- `config_rule_id` (String)
- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

<a id="nestedatt--source"></a>
### Nested Schema for `source`

Required:

- `owner` (String) Indicates whether AWS or the customer owns and manages the CC rule.
  CC Managed Rules are predefined rules owned by AWS. For more information, see [Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config_use-managed-rules.html) in the *developer guide*.
  CC Custom Rules are rules that you can develop either with Guard (``CUSTOM_POLICY``) or LAMlong (``CUSTOM_LAMBDA``). For more information, see [Custom Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config_develop-rules.html) in the *developer guide*.

Optional:

- `custom_policy_details` (Attributes) Provides the runtime system, policy definition, and whether debug logging is enabled. Required when owner is set to ``CUSTOM_POLICY``. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--source--custom_policy_details))
- `source_details` (Attributes List) Provides the source and the message types that cause CC to evaluate your AWS resources against a rule. It also provides the frequency with which you want CC to run evaluations for the rule if the trigger type is periodic.
 If the owner is set to ``CUSTOM_POLICY``, the only acceptable values for the CC rule trigger message type are ``ConfigurationItemChangeNotification`` and ``OversizedConfigurationItemChangeNotification``. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--source--source_details))
- `source_identifier` (String) For CC Managed rules, a predefined identifier from a list. For example, ``IAM_PASSWORD_POLICY`` is a managed rule. To reference a managed rule, see [List of Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html).
 For CC Custom Lambda rules, the identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule's LAMlong function, such as ``arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:custom_rule_name``.
 For CC Custom Policy rules, this field will be ignored.

### Nested Schema for `source.custom_policy_details`

Optional:

- `enable_debug_log_delivery` (Boolean) The boolean expression for enabling debug logging for your CC Custom Policy rule. The default value is ``false``.
- `policy_runtime` (String) The runtime system for your CC Custom Policy rule. Guard is a policy-as-code language that allows you to write policies that are enforced by CC Custom Policy rules. For more information about Guard, see the [Guard GitHub Repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard).
- `policy_text` (String) The policy definition containing the logic for your CC Custom Policy rule.


<a id="nestedatt--source--source_details"></a>
### Nested Schema for `source.source_details`

Optional:

- `event_source` (String) The source of the event, such as an AWS service, that triggers CC to evaluate your AWS resources.
- `maximum_execution_frequency` (String) The frequency at which you want CC to run evaluations for a custom rule with a periodic trigger. If you specify a value for ``MaximumExecutionFrequency``, then ``MessageType`` must use the ``ScheduledNotification`` value.
  By default, rules with a periodic trigger are evaluated every 24 hours. To change the frequency, specify a valid value for the ``MaximumExecutionFrequency`` parameter.
 Based on the valid value you choose, CC runs evaluations once for each valid value. For example, if you choose ``Three_Hours``, CC runs evaluations once every three hours. In this case, ``Three_Hours`` is the frequency of this rule.
- `message_type` (String) The type of notification that triggers CC to run an evaluation for a rule. You can specify the following notification types:
  +   ``ConfigurationItemChangeNotification`` - Triggers an evaluation when CC delivers a configuration item as a result of a resource change.
  +   ``OversizedConfigurationItemChangeNotification`` - Triggers an evaluation when CC delivers an oversized configuration item. CC may generate this notification type when a resource changes and the notification exceeds the maximum size allowed by Amazon SNS.
  +   ``ScheduledNotification`` - Triggers a periodic evaluation at the frequency specified for ``MaximumExecutionFrequency``.
  +   ``ConfigurationSnapshotDeliveryCompleted`` - Triggers a periodic evaluation when CC delivers a configuration snapshot.
  
 If you want your custom rule to be triggered by configuration changes, specify two SourceDetail objects, one for ``ConfigurationItemChangeNotification`` and one for ``OversizedConfigurationItemChangeNotification``.



<a id="nestedatt--compliance"></a>
### Nested Schema for `compliance`

Read-Only:

- `type` (String) Compliance type determined by the Config rule


<a id="nestedatt--evaluation_modes"></a>
### Nested Schema for `evaluation_modes`

Optional:

- `mode` (String) The mode of an evaluation. The valid values are Detective or Proactive.


<a id="nestedatt--scope"></a>
### Nested Schema for `scope`

Optional:

- `compliance_resource_id` (String) The ID of the only AWS resource that you want to trigger an evaluation for the rule. If you specify a resource ID, you must specify one resource type for ``ComplianceResourceTypes``.
- `compliance_resource_types` (List of String) The resource types of only those AWS resources that you want to trigger an evaluation for the rule. You can only specify one type if you also specify a resource ID for ``ComplianceResourceId``.
- `tag_key` (String) The tag key that is applied to only those AWS resources that you want to trigger an evaluation for the rule.
- `tag_value` (String) The tag value applied to only those AWS resources that you want to trigger an evaluation for the rule. If you specify a value for ``TagValue``, you must also specify a value for ``TagKey``.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_config_config_rule.example
  id = "config_rule_name"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_config_config_rule.example "config_rule_name"
```
