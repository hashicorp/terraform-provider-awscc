# awscc_logs_subscription_filter (Resource)

The ``AWS::Logs::SubscriptionFilter`` resource specifies a subscription filter and associates it with the specified log group. Subscription filters allow you to subscribe to a real-time stream of log events and have them delivered to a specific destination. Currently, the supported destinations are:
  +  An Amazon Kinesis data stream belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
  +  A logical destination that belongs to a different account, for cross-account delivery.
  +  An Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
  +  An LAMlong function that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
  
 There can be as many as two subscription filters associated with a log group.

## Example Usage

### CloudWatch Logs Subscription Filter with Lambda Processing

Creates a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter that forwards log entries matching a specific pattern to a Lambda function for processing, with complete setup including the required IAM roles, Lambda function, and necessary permissions.

## Schema

### Required

- `destination_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the destination.
- `filter_pattern` (String) The filtering expressions that restrict what gets delivered to the destination AWS resource. For more information about the filter pattern syntax, see [Filter and Pattern Syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html).
- `log_group_name` (String) The log group to associate with the subscription filter. All log events that are uploaded to this log group are filtered and delivered to the specified AWS resource if the filter pattern matches the log events.

### Optional

- `apply_on_transformed_logs` (Boolean) This parameter is valid only for log groups that have an active log transformer. For more information about log transformers, see [PutTransformer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutTransformer.html).
 If this value is ``true``, the subscription filter is applied on the transformed version of the log events instead of the original ingested log events.
- `distribution` (String) The method used to distribute log data to the destination, which can be either random or grouped by log stream.
- `emit_system_fields` (List of String)
- `field_selection_criteria` (String)
- `filter_name` (String) The name of the subscription filter.
- `role_arn` (String) The ARN of an IAM role that grants CWL permissions to deliver ingested log events to the destination stream. You don't need to provide the ARN when you are working with a logical destination for cross-account delivery.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_logs_subscription_filter.example
  identity = {
    filter_name    = "filter_name"
    log_group_name = "log_group_name"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `filter_name` (String) The name of the subscription filter
- `log_group_name` (String) The log group to associate with the subscription filter

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed
- `region` (String) Region where this resource is managed

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_logs_subscription_filter.example
  id = "filter_name|log_group_name"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_logs_subscription_filter.example "filter_name|log_group_name"
```
