AWS::NetworkManager::ConnectAttachment Resource Type Definition

## Example Usage

### Core Network Connect Attachment with GRE Protocol

To create a connect attachment that links a transport attachment to a core network using GRE protocol, configure the core network ID, transport attachment ID, and edge location in your preferred AWS region.

~> This example is generated by LLM using Amazon Bedrock and validated using terraform validate, apply and destroy. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date. We recommend independently verifying the content.

```terraform
data "aws_region" "current" {}

# Example Connect Attachment - This is an example template, not intended for direct use
# since it requires existing core network, transport attachment, and VPC resources
resource "awscc_networkmanager_connect_attachment" "example" {
  # The ID of the core network to attach to - Replace with your actual core network ID
  core_network_id = "core-network-xxxx"

  # The ID of existing transport attachment (e.g., VPC attachment) - Replace with actual attachment ID
  transport_attachment_id = "attachment-xxxx"

  # The edge location for the attachment (AWS Region)
  edge_location = data.aws_region.current.name

  # Configuration options for the connect attachment
  options = {
    protocol = "GRE" # The tunnel protocol for the connect attachment
  }

  # Optional tags for the attachment
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_networkmanager_connect_attachment.example
  identity = {
    attachment_id = "attachment_id"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `attachment_id` (String) The ID of the attachment

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_networkmanager_connect_attachment.example
  id = "attachment_id"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_networkmanager_connect_attachment.example "attachment_id"
```
