# awscc_s3vectors_index (Resource)

Resource Type definition for AWS::S3Vectors::Index



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `data_type` (String) The data type of the vectors to be inserted into the vector index.
- `dimension` (Number) The dimensions of the vectors to be inserted into the vector index.
- `distance_metric` (String) The distance metric to be used for similarity search.

### Optional

- `index_name` (String) The name of the vector index to create.
- `metadata_configuration` (Attributes) The metadata configuration for the vector index. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata_configuration))
- `vector_bucket_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the vector bucket.
- `vector_bucket_name` (String) The name of the vector bucket that contains the vector index.

### Read-Only

- `creation_time` (String) Date and time when the vector index was created.
- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `index_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the index

### Nested Schema for `metadata_configuration`

Optional:

- `non_filterable_metadata_keys` (Set of String) Non-filterable metadata keys allow you to enrich vectors with additional context during storage and retrieval. Unlike default metadata keys, these keys cannot be used as query filters. Non-filterable metadata keys can be retrieved but cannot be searched, queried, or filtered. You can access non-filterable metadata keys of your vectors after finding the vectors.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_s3vectors_index.example
  identity = {
    index_arn = "index_arn"
  }
}
```

### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `index_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the index

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed
- `region` (String) Region where this resource is managed

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_s3vectors_index.example
  id = "index_arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_s3vectors_index.example "index_arn"
```
