# awscc_datazone_project (Resource)

Amazon DataZone projects are business use case?based groupings of people, assets (data), and tools used to simplify access to the AWS analytics.

## Example Usage

Creates an Amazon DataZone project in a domain.

```terraform
resource "awscc_datazone_project" "example" {
  domain_identifier = awscc_datazone_domain.example.id
  name              = "example"
}

resource "awscc_datazone_domain" "example" {
  name                  = "example"
  domain_execution_role = awscc_iam_role.awscc_datazone_role.arn
  description           = "Datazone domain example"

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_datazone_project.example
  identity = {
    domain_id = "domain_id"
    id        = "id"
  }
}
```
