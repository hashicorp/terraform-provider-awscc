# awscc_ec2_gateway_route_table_association (Resource)

Associates a gateway with a route table. The gateway and route table must be in the same VPC. This association causes the incoming traffic to the gateway to be routed according to the routes in the route table.

## Example Usage

### Internet Gateway Association

Associate an internet gateway with a route table.
```terraform
resource "awscc_ec2_gateway_route_table_association" "igw" {
  gateway_id     = awscc_ec2_internet_gateway.igw.id
  route_table_id = awscc_ec2_route_table.internet.id
}

resource "awscc_ec2_vpc_gateway_attachment" "igw" {
  internet_gateway_id = awscc_ec2_internet_gateway.igw.id
  vpc_id              = awscc_ec2_vpc.vpc.id
}

resource "awscc_ec2_internet_gateway" "igw" {
  tags = [{
    key   = "Managed By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

resource "awscc_ec2_route_table" "internet" {
  vpc_id = awscc_ec2_vpc.vpc.id
  tags = [{
    key   = "Managed By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

resource "awscc_ec2_vpc" "vpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Managed By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```

### Virtual Private Gateway Association

Associate a virtual private gateway with a route table.
```terraform
resource "awscc_ec2_gateway_route_table_association" "vpn" {
  gateway_id     = awscc_ec2_vpn_gateway.vpn.id
  route_table_id = awscc_ec2_route_table.vpn.id
}

resource "awscc_ec2_vpc_gateway_attachment" "vpn" {
  vpn_gateway_id = awscc_ec2_vpn_gateway.vpn.id
  vpc_id         = awscc_ec2_vpc.vpc.id
}

resource "awscc_ec2_vpn_gateway" "vpn" {
  type = "ipsec.1"
  tags = [
    {
      key   = "Modified By"
      value = "AWSCC"
    }
  ]
}

resource "awscc_ec2_route_table" "vpn" {
  vpc_id = awscc_ec2_vpc.vpc.id
  tags = [{
    key   = "Managed By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

resource "awscc_ec2_vpc" "vpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Managed By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `gateway_id` (String) The ID of the gateway.
- `route_table_id` (String) The ID of the route table.

### Read-Only

- `association_id` (String) The route table association ID.
- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_gateway_route_table_association.example
  identity = {
    gateway_id = "gateway_id"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `gateway_id` (String) The ID of the gateway

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed
- `region` (String) Region where this resource is managed

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_gateway_route_table_association.example
  id = "gateway_id"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_ec2_gateway_route_table_association.example "gateway_id"
```
