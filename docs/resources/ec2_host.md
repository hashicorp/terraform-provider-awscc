## Example Usage

### First example - Create dedicated host specifying instance family
```terraform
resource "awscc_ec2_host" "dedicated_host" {
  availability_zone = "us-east-1a"
  auto_placement    = "on"
  instance_family   = "m5"
}
```

### Second example - Create dedicated host specifying instance type
```terraform
resource "awscc_ec2_host" "dedicated_host1" {
  availability_zone = "us-east-1b"
  auto_placement    = "on"
  instance_type     = "m5.xlarge"
}

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_host.example
  identity = {
    host_id = "host_id"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `host_id` (String) ID of the host created

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed
- `region` (String) Region where this resource is managed

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_host.example
  id = "host_id"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_ec2_host.example "host_id"
```
