- `database_server_type` (String) The database server model type of the Exadata infrastructure. For the list of valid model names, use the ListDbSystemShapes operation.
- `display_name` (String) The user-friendly name for the Exadata infrastructure.
- `maintenance_window` (Attributes) The scheduling details for the maintenance window. Patching and system updates take place during the maintenance window. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--maintenance_window))
- `shape` (String) The model name of the Exadata infrastructure.
- `storage_count` (Number) The number of storage servers that are activated for the Exadata infrastructure.
- `storage_server_type` (String) The storage server model type of the Exadata infrastructure. For the list of valid model names, use the ListDbSystemShapes operation.

- `db_server_ids` (List of String) The list of database server identifiers for the Exadata infrastructure.
- `db_server_version` (String) The software version of the database servers (dom0) in the Exadata infrastructure.
- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `max_cpu_count` (Number) The total number of CPU cores available on the Exadata infrastructure.
- `max_data_storage_in_t_bs` (Number) The total amount of data disk group storage, in terabytes (TB), that's available on the Exadata infrastructure.
- `max_db_node_storage_size_in_g_bs` (Number) The total amount of local node storage, in gigabytes (GB), that's available on the Exadata infrastructure.
- `max_memory_in_g_bs` (Number) The total amount of memory, in gigabytes (GB), that's available on the Exadata infrastructure.
- `memory_size_in_g_bs` (Number) The amount of memory, in gigabytes (GB), that's allocated on the Exadata infrastructure.
- `oci_resource_anchor_name` (String) The name of the OCI resource anchor for the Exadata infrastructure.
- `oci_url` (String) The HTTPS link to the Exadata infrastructure in OCI.
- `ocid` (String) The OCID of the Exadata infrastructure.
- `storage_server_version` (String) The software version of the storage servers on the Exadata infrastructure.
- `total_storage_size_in_g_bs` (Number) The total amount of storage, in gigabytes (GB), on the the Exadata infrastructure.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_odb_cloud_exadata_infrastructure.example
  identity = {
    cloud_exadata_infrastructure_arn = "cloud_exadata_infrastructure_arn"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `cloud_exadata_infrastructure_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Exadata infrastructure

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed
- `region` (String) Region where this resource is managed

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_odb_cloud_exadata_infrastructure.example
  id = "cloud_exadata_infrastructure_arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_odb_cloud_exadata_infrastructure.example "cloud_exadata_infrastructure_arn"
```
