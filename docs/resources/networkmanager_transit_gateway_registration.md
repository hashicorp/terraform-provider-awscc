# awscc_networkmanager_transit_gateway_registration (Resource)

The AWS::NetworkManager::TransitGatewayRegistration type registers a transit gateway in your global network. The transit gateway can be in any AWS Region, but it must be owned by the same AWS account that owns the global network. You cannot register a transit gateway in more than one global network.

## Example Usage

### Basic

Note that the ARN is not returned by [awscc_ec2_transit_gateway](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/awscc/latest/docs/resources/ec2_transit_gateway) as of 20 July 2023 and is thus formatted manually in the example below:

```terraform
data "aws_partition" "current" {}
data "aws_region" "current" {}
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

resource "awscc_networkmanager_global_network" "example" {}

resource "awscc_ec2_transit_gateway" "example" {}

resource "awscc_networkmanager_transit_gateway_registration" "example" {
  global_network_id   = awscc_networkmanager_global_network.example.id
  transit_gateway_arn = "arn:${data.aws_partition.current.partition}:ec2:${data.aws_region.current.name}:${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:transit-gateway/${awscc_ec2_transit_gateway.example.id}"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `global_network_id` (String) The ID of the global network.
- `transit_gateway_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the transit gateway.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_networkmanager_transit_gateway_registration.example
  identity = {
    global_network_id   = "global_network_id"
    transit_gateway_arn = "transit_gateway_arn"
  }
}
```

### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `global_network_id` (String) The ID of the global network
- `transit_gateway_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the transit gateway

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The ID of the AWS account

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_networkmanager_transit_gateway_registration.example
  id = "global_network_id|transit_gateway_arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_networkmanager_transit_gateway_registration.example "global_network_id|transit_gateway_arn"
```
