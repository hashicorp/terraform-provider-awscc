# awscc_networkmanager_transit_gateway_registration (Resource)

The AWS::NetworkManager::TransitGatewayRegistration type registers a transit gateway in your global network. The transit gateway can be in any AWS Region, but it must be owned by the same AWS account that owns the global network. You cannot register a transit gateway in more than one global network.

## Example Usage

### Basic

Note that the ARN is not returned by [awscc_ec2_transit_gateway](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/awscc/latest/docs/resources/ec2_transit_gateway) as of 20 July 2023 and is thus formatted manually in the example below:

```terraform
data "aws_partition" "current" {}
# Note: Using data.aws_region.current.region (AWS provider v6.0+)
# For AWS provider < v6.0, use data.aws_region.current.name instead
data "aws_region" "current" {}
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

resource "awscc_networkmanager_global_network" "example" {}

resource "awscc_ec2_transit_gateway" "example" {}

resource "awscc_networkmanager_transit_gateway_registration" "example" {
  global_network_id   = awscc_networkmanager_global_network.example.id
  transit_gateway_arn = "arn:${data.aws_partition.current.partition}:ec2:${data.aws_region.current.region}:${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:transit-gateway/${awscc_ec2_transit_gateway.example.id}"
}
```
