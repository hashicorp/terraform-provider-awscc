<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of this SLO.

### Optional

- `burn_rate_configurations` (Attributes Set) Each object in this array defines the length of the look-back window used to calculate one burn rate metric for this SLO. The burn rate measures how fast the service is consuming the error budget, relative to the attainment goal of the SLO. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--burn_rate_configurations))
- `description` (String) An optional description for this SLO. Default is 'No description'
- `goal` (Attributes) A structure that contains the attributes that determine the goal of the SLO. This includes the time period for evaluation and the attainment threshold. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--goal))
- `request_based_sli` (Attributes) This structure contains information about the performance metric that a request-based SLO monitors. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--request_based_sli))
- `sli` (Attributes) This structure contains information about the performance metric that an SLO monitors. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sli))
- `tags` (Attributes Set) The list of tag keys and values associated with the resource you specified (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))

### Read-Only

- `arn` (String) The ARN of this SLO.
- `created_time` (Number) Epoch time in seconds of the time that this SLO was created
- `evaluation_type` (String) Displays whether this is a period-based SLO or a request-based SLO.
- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `last_updated_time` (Number) Epoch time in seconds of the time that this SLO was most recently updated

<a id="nestedatt--burn_rate_configurations"></a>
### Nested Schema for `burn_rate_configurations`

Optional:

- `look_back_window_minutes` (Number) The number of minutes to use as the look-back window.


<a id="nestedatt--goal"></a>
### Nested Schema for `goal`

Optional:

- `attainment_goal` (Number) The threshold that determines if the goal is being met. An attainment goal is the ratio of good periods that meet the threshold requirements to the total periods within the interval. For example, an attainment goal of 99.9% means that within your interval, you are targeting 99.9% of the periods to be in healthy state.
If you omit this parameter, 99 is used to represent 99% as the attainment goal.
- `interval` (Attributes) The time period used to evaluate the SLO. It can be either a calendar interval or rolling interval.
If you omit this parameter, a rolling interval of 7 days is used. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--goal--interval))
- `warning_threshold` (Number) The percentage of remaining budget over total budget that you want to get warnings for. If you omit this parameter, the default of 50.0 is used.

<a id="nestedatt--goal--interval"></a>
### Nested Schema for `goal.interval`

Optional:

- `calendar_interval` (Attributes) If the interval for this service level objective is a calendar interval, this structure contains the interval specifications. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--goal--interval--calendar_interval))
- `rolling_interval` (Attributes) If the interval is a calendar interval, this structure contains the interval specifications. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--goal--interval--rolling_interval))

<a id="nestedatt--goal--interval--calendar_interval"></a>
### Nested Schema for `goal.interval.calendar_interval`

Optional:

- `duration` (Number) Specifies the duration of each calendar interval. For example, if `Duration` is 1 and `DurationUnit` is `MONTH`, each interval is one month, aligned with the calendar.
- `duration_unit` (String) Specifies the calendar interval unit.
- `start_time` (Number) Epoch time in seconds you want the first interval to start. Be sure to choose a time that configures the intervals the way that you want. For example, if you want weekly intervals starting on Mondays at 6 a.m., be sure to specify a start time that is a Monday at 6 a.m.
As soon as one calendar interval ends, another automatically begins.


<a id="nestedatt--goal--interval--rolling_interval"></a>
### Nested Schema for `goal.interval.rolling_interval`

Optional:
