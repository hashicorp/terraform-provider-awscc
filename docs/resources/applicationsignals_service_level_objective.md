Resource Type definition for AWS::ApplicationSignals::ServiceLevelObjective

## Example Usage

### API Gateway Latency SLO Monitor

Creates a Service Level Objective (SLO) that monitors API Gateway latency with a 99.9% attainment goal, tracking p90 latency against a 1000ms threshold over a 7-day rolling window with multiple burn rate configurations.

### Optional

- `burn_rate_configurations` (Attributes Set) Each object in this array defines the length of the look-back window used to calculate one burn rate metric for this SLO.
