# awscc_iot_fleet_metric (Resource)

An aggregated metric of certain devices in your fleet

## Example Usage

### IoT Fleet Metric for Device Connectivity

Creates an IoT Fleet Metric that tracks device connectivity status by querying the AWS Things index every 5 minutes, requiring IoT Fleet Indexing to be enabled first.

~> This example is generated by LLM using Amazon Bedrock and validated using terraform validate, apply and destroy. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date. We recommend independently verifying the content.

```terraform
# Enable IoT Fleet Indexing
resource "aws_iot_indexing_configuration" "example" {
  thing_indexing_configuration {
    thing_connectivity_indexing_mode = "STATUS"
    thing_indexing_mode              = "REGISTRY_AND_SHADOW"
  }
}

# Add a time delay for indexing to complete
resource "time_sleep" "wait_60_seconds" {
  depends_on      = [aws_iot_indexing_configuration.example]
  create_duration = "60s"
}

# Create an IoT Fleet Metric
resource "awscc_iot_fleet_metric" "example" {
  depends_on        = [time_sleep.wait_60_seconds]
  metric_name       = "device-connectivity-metric"
  description       = "Fleet metric to track device connectivity status"
  index_name        = "AWS_Things"
  query_string      = "connectivity.connected:true"
  query_version     = "2017-09-30"
  aggregation_field = "connectivity.connected"
  period            = 300 # 5 minutes

  aggregation_type = {
    name = "Statistics"
    values = [
      "count"
    ]
  }

  unit = "Count"

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```

### Nested Schema for `aggregation_type`

Optional:

- `name` (String) Fleet Indexing aggregation type names such as Statistics, Percentiles and Cardinality

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_iot_fleet_metric.example
  identity = {
    metric_name = "metric_name"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `metric_name` (String) The name of the fleet metric

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The ID of the AWS account
- `region` (String) The AWS region where the resource is located

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_iot_fleet_metric.example
  id = "metric_name"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_iot_fleet_metric.example "metric_name"
```
