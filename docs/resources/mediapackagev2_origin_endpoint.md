### Nested Schema for `hls_manifests`

Required:

- `manifest_name` (String) <p>A short short string that's appended to the endpoint URL. The manifest name creates a unique path to this endpoint. If you don't enter a value, MediaPackage uses the default manifest name, index. MediaPackage automatically inserts the format extension, such as .m3u8. You can't use the same manifest name if you use HLS manifest and low-latency HLS manifest. The manifestName on the HLSManifest object overrides the manifestName you provided on the originEndpoint object.</p>

Optional:

- `child_manifest_name` (String) <p>A short string that's appended to the endpoint URL. The child manifest name creates a unique path to this endpoint. If you don't enter a value, MediaPackage uses the default child manifest name, index_1. The manifestName on the HLSManifest object overrides the manifestName you provided on the originEndpoint object.</p>
- `filter_configuration` (Attributes) <p>Filter configuration includes settings for manifest filtering, start and end times, and time delay that apply to all of your egress requests for this manifest. </p> (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--hls_manifests--filter_configuration))
- `manifest_window_seconds` (Number) <p>The total duration (in seconds) of the manifest's content.</p>
- `program_date_time_interval_seconds` (Number) <p>Inserts EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags in the output manifest at the interval that you specify. If you don't enter an interval, 
         EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags aren't included in the manifest. 
         The tags sync the stream to the wall clock so that viewers can seek to a specific time in the playback timeline on the player. 
         ID3Timed metadata messages generate every 5 seconds whenever the content is ingested.</p>
         <p>Irrespective of this parameter, if any ID3Timed metadata is in the HLS input, it is passed through to the HLS output.</p>
- `scte_hls` (Attributes) <p>The SCTE configuration.</p> (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--hls_manifests--scte_hls))
- `url` (String) <p>The egress domain URL for stream delivery from MediaPackage.</p>

<a id="nestedatt--segment"></a>
### Nested Schema for `segment`

Optional:

- `encryption` (Attributes) <p>The parameters for encrypting content.</p> (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--segment--encryption))
- `include_iframe_only_streams` (Boolean) <p>When selected, the stream set includes an additional I-frame only stream, along with the other tracks. If false, this extra stream is not included. MediaPackage generates an I-frame only stream from the first rendition in the manifest. The service inserts EXT-I-FRAMES-ONLY tags in the output manifest, and then generates and includes an I-frames only playlist in the stream. This playlist permits player functionality like fast forward and rewind.</p>
- `scte` (Attributes) <p>The SCTE configuration.</p> (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--segment--scte))
- `segment_duration_seconds` (Number) <p>The duration (in seconds) of each segment. Enter a value equal to, or a multiple of, the input segment duration. If the value that you enter is different from the input segment duration, MediaPackage rounds segments to the nearest multiple of the input segment duration.</p>
- `segment_name` (String) <p>The name that describes the segment. The name is the base name of the segment used in all content manifests inside of the endpoint. You can't use spaces in the name.</p>
- `ts_include_dvb_subtitles` (Boolean) <p>By default, MediaPackage excludes all digital video broadcasting (DVB) subtitles from the output. When selected, MediaPackage passes through DVB subtitles into the output.</p>
- `ts_use_audio_rendition_group` (Boolean) <p>When selected, MediaPackage bundles all audio tracks in a rendition group. All other tracks in the stream can be used with any audio rendition from the group.</p>

<a id="nestedatt--segment--encryption"></a>
### Nested Schema for `segment.encryption`

Required:

- `encryption_method` (Attributes) <p>The encryption type.</p> (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--segment--encryption--encryption_method))
- `speke_key_provider` (Attributes) <p>The parameters for the SPEKE key provider.</p> (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--segment--encryption--speke_key_provider))

Optional:

- `constant_initialization_vector` (String) <p>A 128-bit, 16-byte hex value represented by a 32-character string, used in conjunction with the key for encrypting content. If you don't specify a value, then MediaPackage creates the constant initialization vector (IV).</p>
- `key_rotation_interval_seconds` (Number) <p>The frequency (in seconds) of key changes for live workflows, in which content is streamed real time. The service retrieves content keys before the live content begins streaming, and then retrieves them as needed over the lifetime of the workflow. By default, key rotation is set to 300 seconds (5 minutes), the minimum rotation interval, which is equivalent to setting it to 300. If you don't enter an interval, content keys aren't rotated.</p>
         <p>The following example setting causes the service to rotate keys every thirty minutes: <code>1800</code>
         </p>

<a id="nestedatt--segment--encryption--speke_key_provider"></a>
### Nested Schema for `segment.encryption.speke_key_provider`

Required:

- `drm_systems` (List of String) <p>The DRM solution provider you're using to protect your content during distribution.</p>
- `encryption_contract_configuration` (Attributes) <p>Configure one or more content encryption keys for your endpoints that use SPEKE Version 2.0. The encryption contract defines which content keys are used to encrypt the audio and video tracks in your stream. To configure the encryption contract, specify which audio and video encryption presets to use.</p> (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--segment--encryption--speke_key_provider--encryption_contract_configuration))
- `resource_id` (String) <p>The unique identifier for the content. The service sends this to the key server to identify the current endpoint. How unique you make this depends on how fine-grained you want access controls to be. The service does not permit you to use the same ID for two simultaneous encryption processes. The resource ID is also known as the content ID.</p>
         <p>The following example shows a resource ID: <code>MovieNight20171126093045</code>
         </p>
- `role_arn` (String) <p>The ARN for the IAM role granted by the key provider that provides access to the key provider API. This role must have a trust policy that allows MediaPackage to assume the role, and it must have a sufficient permissions policy to allow access to the specific key retrieval URL. Get this from your DRM solution provider.</p>
         <p>Valid format: <code>arn:aws:iam::{accountID}:role/{name}</code>. The following example shows a role ARN: <code>arn:aws:iam::444455556666:role/SpekeAccess</code>
         </p>
- `url` (String) <p>The URL of the API Gateway proxy that you set up to talk to your key server. The API Gateway proxy must reside in the same AWS Region as MediaPackage and must start with https://.</p>
