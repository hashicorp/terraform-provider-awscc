## Example Usage

### Basic example

```terraform
resource "awscc_iam_instance_profile" "example" {
  roles                 = [awscc_iam_role.example.role_name]
  instance_profile_name = "dev_profile"
  path                  = "/compute/"
}

resource "awscc_iam_role_policy" "example" {
  policy_name = "minimal_ssm_policy"
  role_name   = awscc_iam_role.example.role_name
  policy_document = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "ssm:UpdateInstanceInformation",
          "ssmmessages:CreateControlChannel",
          "ssmmessages:CreateDataChannel",
          "ssmmessages:OpenControlChannel",
          "ssmmessages:OpenDataChannel"
        ]
        Effect   = "Allow"

## Schema

### Required

- `roles` (Set of String) The name of the role to associate with the instance profile. Only one role can be assigned to an EC2 instance at a time, and all applications on the instance share the same role and permissions.

### Optional

- `instance_profile_name` (String) The name of the instance profile to create.
 This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-
- `path` (String) The path to the instance profile. For more information about paths, see [IAM Identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
 This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/).
 This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (``\u0021``) through the DEL character (``\u007F``), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

### Read-Only

- `arn` (String)
- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_iam_instance_profile.example
  id = "instance_profile_name"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_iam_instance_profile.example "instance_profile_name"
```
