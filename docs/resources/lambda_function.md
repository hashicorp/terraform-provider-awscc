# awscc_lambda_function (Resource)

The ``AWS::Lambda::Function`` resource creates a Lambda function. To create a function, you need a [deployment package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html) and an [execution role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.html). The deployment package is a .zip file archive or container image that contains your function code. The execution role grants the function permission to use AWS services, such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and AWS X-Ray for request tracing.
 You set the package type to ``Image`` if the deployment package is a [container image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-images.html). For a container image, the code property must include the URI of a container image in the Amazon ECR registry. You do not need to specify the handler and runtime properties. 
 You set the package type to ``Zip`` if the deployment package is a [.zip file archive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lam

## Example Usage

### Basic example
To create a AWS lambda function with basic details
```terraform
resource "awscc_iam_role" "main" {

- `code_signing_config_arn` (String) To enable code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration. A code-signing configuration includes a set of signing profiles, which define the trusted publishers for this function.
- `dead_letter_config` (Attributes) A dead-letter queue configuration that specifies the queue or topic where Lambda sends asynchronous events when they fail processing. For more information, see [Dead-letter queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#invocation-dlq). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--dead_letter_config))
- `description` (String) A description of the function.
- `environment` (Attributes) Environment variables that are accessible from function code during execution. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--environment))
- `ephemeral_storage` (Attributes) The size of the function's ``/tmp`` directory in MB. The default value is 512, but it can be any whole number between 512 and 10,240 MB. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--ephemeral_storage))
- `file_system_configs` (Attributes List) Connection settings for an Amazon EFS file system. To connect a function to a file system, a mount target must be available in every Availability Zone that your function connects to. If your template contains an [AWS::EFS::MountTarget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-efs-mounttarget.html) resource, you must also specify a ``DependsOn`` attribute to ensure that the mount target is created or updated before the function.
 For more information about using the ``DependsOn`` attribute, see [DependsOn Attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-dependson.html). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--file_system_configs))
- `function_name` (String) The name of the Lambda function, up to 64 characters in length. If you don't specify a name, CFN generates one.
 If you specify a name, you cannot perform updates that require replacement of this resource. You can perform updates that require no or some interruption. If you must replace the resource, specify a new name.
- `handler` (String) The name of the method within your code that Lambda calls to run your function. Handler is required if the deployment package is a .zip file archive. The format includes the file name. It can also include namespaces and other qualifiers, depending on the runtime. For more information, see [Lambda programming model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/foundation-progmodel.html).
- `image_config` (Attributes) Configuration values that override the container image Dockerfile settings. For more information, see [Container image settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html#images-parms). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--image_config))

When [Lambda SnapStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart-security.html) is activated, Lambda also uses this key is to encrypt your function's snapshot. If you deploy your function using a container image, Lambda also uses this key to encrypt your function when it's deployed. Note that this is not the same key that's used to protect your container image in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR). If you don't provide a customer managed key, Lambda uses a default service key.
- `layers` (List of String) A list of [function layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html) to add to the function's execution environment. Specify each layer by its ARN, including the version.

- `memory_size` (Number) The amount of [memory available to the function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-function-common.html#configuration-memory-console) at runtime. Increasing the function memory also increases its CPU allocation. The default value is 128 MB. The value can be any multiple of 1 MB. Note that new AWS accounts have reduced concurrency and memory quotas. AWS raises these quotas automatically based on your usage. You can also request a quota increase.
- `package_type` (String) The type of deployment package. Set to ``Image`` for container image and set ``Zip`` for .zip file archive.
- `reserved_concurrent_executions` (Number) The number of simultaneous executions to reserve for the function.
- `runtime` (String) The identifier of the function's [runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html). Runtime is required if the deployment package is a .zip file archive.
 The following list includes deprecated runtimes. For more information, see [Runtime deprecation policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html#runtime-support-policy).
- `runtime_management_config` (Attributes) Sets the runtime management configuration for a function's version. For more information, see [Runtime updates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-update.html). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--runtime_management_config))
- `snap_start` (Attributes) The function's [SnapStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html) setting. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--snap_start))
- `tags` (Attributes Set) A list of [tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/tagging.html) to apply to the function. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
- `timeout` (Number) The amount of time (in seconds) that Lambda allows a function to run before stopping it. The default is 3 seconds. The maximum allowed value is 900 seconds. For more information, see [Lambda execution environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-context.html).
- `tracing_config` (Attributes) Set ``Mode`` to ``Active`` to sample and trace a subset of incoming requests with [X-Ray](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-xray.html). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tracing_config))
- `vpc_config` (Attributes) For network connectivity to AWS resources in a VPC, specify a list of security groups and subnets in the VPC. When you connect a function to a VPC, it can access resources and the internet only through that VPC. For more information, see [Configuring a Lambda function to access resources in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--vpc_config))

### Read-Only

- `arn` (String)
- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `snap_start_response` (Attributes) The function's [SnapStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html) setting. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--snap_start_response))

<a id="nestedatt--code"></a>
### Nested Schema for `code`

Optional:

- `image_uri` (String) URI of a [container image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-images.html) in the Amazon ECR registry.
- `s3_bucket` (String) An Amazon S3 bucket in the same AWS-Region as your function. The bucket can be in a different AWS-account.
- `s3_key` (String) The Amazon S3 key of the deployment package.
- `s3_object_version` (String) For versioned objects, the version of the deployment package object to use.
- `zip_file` (String) (Node.js and Python) The source code of your Lambda function. If you include your function source inline with this parameter, CFN places it in a file named ``index`` and zips it to create a [deployment package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html). This zip file cannot exceed 4MB. For the ``Handler`` property, the first part of the handler identifier must be ``index``. For example, ``index.handler``.
  For JSON, you must escape quotes and special characters such as newline (``\n``) with a backslash.
 If you specify a function that interacts with an AWS CloudFormation custom resource, you don't have to write your own functions to send responses to the custom resource that invoked the function. AWS CloudFormation provides a response module ([cfn-response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-lambda-function-code-cfnresponsemodule.html)) that simplifies sending responses. See [Using Lambda with CloudFormation](https://docs

This is the best choice for most customers to ensure they always benefit from runtime updates.
 + *FunctionUpdate* - LAM updates the runtime of you function to the most recent and secure runtime version when you update your function. This approach synchronizes runtime updates with function deployments, giving you control over when runtime updates are applied and allowing you to detect and mitigate rare runtime update incompatibilities early. When using this setting, you need to regularly update your functions to keep their runtime up-to-date.
