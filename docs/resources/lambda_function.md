  The AWS::Lambda::Function resource creates a Lambda function. To create a function, you need a deployment package https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html and an execution role https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.html. The deployment package is a .zip file archive or container image that contains your function code. The execution role grants the function permission to use AWS services, such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and AWS X-Ray for request tracing.
  You set the package type to Image if the deployment package is a container image https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-images.html. For these functions, include the URI of the container image in the ECR registry in the ImageUri property of the Code property https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-lambda-function-code.html#cfn-lambda-function-code-imageuri. You do not need to specify the handler and runtime properties.
  You set the package type to Zip if the deployment package is a .zip file archive https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html#gettingstarted-package-zip. For these functions, specify the S3 location of your .zip file in the Code property. Alternatively, for Node.js and Python functions, you can define your function inline in the ZipFile property of the Code property https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-lambda-function-code.html#cfn-lambda-function-code-zipfile. In both cases, you must also specify the handler and runtime properties.
  You can use code signing https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-codesigning.html if your deployment package is a .zip file archive. To enable code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration. When a user attempts to deploy a code package with UpdateFunctionCode, Lambda checks that the code package has a valid signature from a trusted publisher. The code-signing configuration includes a set of signing profiles, which define the trusted publishers for this function.
  When you update a AWS::Lambda::Function resource, CFNshort calls the UpdateFunctionConfiguration https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/api/API_UpdateFunctionConfiguration.html and UpdateFunctionCode https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/api/API_UpdateFunctionCode.html LAM APIs under the hood. Because these calls happen sequentially, and invocations can happen between these calls, your function may encounter errors in the time between the calls. For example, if you remove an environment variable, and the code that references that environment variable in the same CFNshort update, you may see invocation errors related to a missing environment variable.

# awscc_lambda_function (Resource)

The ``AWS::Lambda::Function`` resource creates a Lambda function. To create a function, you need a [deployment package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html) and an [execution role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.html). The deployment package is a .zip file archive or container image that contains your function code. The execution role grants the function permission to use AWS services, such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and AWS X-Ray for request tracing.
 You set the package type to ``Image`` if the deployment package is a [container image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-images.html). For these functions, include the URI of the container image in the ECR registry in the [ImageUri property of the Code property](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-lambda-function-code.html#cfn-lambda-function-code-imageuri). You do not need to specify the handler and runtime properties. 
 You set the package type to ``Zip`` if the deployment package is a [.zip file archive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html#gettingstarted-package-zip). For these functions, specify the S3 location of your .zip file in the ``Code`` property. Alternatively, for Node.js and Python functions, you can define your function inline in the [ZipFile property of the Code property](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-lambda-function-code.html#cfn-lambda-function-code-zipfile). In both cases, you must also specify the handler and runtime properties.
 You can use [code signing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-codesigning.html) if your deployment package is a .zip file archive. To enable code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration. When a user attempts to deploy a code package with ``UpdateFunctionCode``, Lambda checks that the code package has a valid signature from a trusted publisher. The code-signing configuration includes a set of signing profiles, which define the trusted publishers for this function.
 When you update a ``AWS::Lambda::Function`` resource, CFNshort calls the [UpdateFunctionConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/api/API_UpdateFunctionConfiguration.html) and [UpdateFunctionCode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/api/API_UpdateFunctionCode.html) LAM APIs under the hood. Because these calls happen sequentially, and invocations can happen between these calls, your function may encounter errors in the time between the calls. For example, if you remove an environment variable, and the code that references that environment variable in the same CFNshort update, you may see invocation errors related to a missing environment variable. To work around this, you can invoke your function against a version or alias by default, rather than the ``$LATEST`` version.
 Note that you configure [provisioned concurrency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/provisioned-concurrency.html) on a ``AWS::Lambda::Version`` or a ``AWS::Lambda::Alias``.
 For a complete introduction to Lambda functions, see [What is Lambda?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-welcome.html) in the *Lambda developer guide.*

    variables = {
      MY_KEY_1 = "MY_VALUE_1"
      MY_KEY_2 = "MY_VALUE_2"
    }
  }
}
```

### Ephemeral storage example
To create a AWS lambda function using Ephemeral storage
```terraform
resource "awscc_iam_role" "main" {
  description = "AWS IAM role for lambda function"
  assume_role_policy_document = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
        Effect = "Allow"
        Sid    = ""
        Principal = {
          Service = "lambda.amazonaws.com"
        }
      },
    ]
  })
}

data "archive_file" "main" {
  type        = "zip"
  source_file = "main.py"

## Schema

### Required

- `code` (Attributes) The code for the function. You can define your function code in multiple ways:
  +  For .zip deployment packages, you can specify the S3 location of the .zip file in the ``S3Bucket``, ``S3Key``, and ``S3ObjectVersion`` properties.
  +  For .zip deployment packages, you can alternatively define the function code inline in the ``ZipFile`` property. This method works only for Node.js and Python functions.
  +  For container images, specify the URI of your container image in the ECR registry in the ``ImageUri`` property. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--code))
- `role` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function's execution role.

### Optional

- `architectures` (List of String) The instruction set architecture that the function supports. Enter a string array with one of the valid values (arm64 or x86_64). The default value is ``x86_64``.
- `code_signing_config_arn` (String) To enable code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration. A code-signing configuration includes a set of signing profiles, which define the trusted publishers for this function.
- `dead_letter_config` (Attributes) A dead-letter queue configuration that specifies the queue or topic where Lambda sends asynchronous events when they fail processing. For more information, see [Dead-letter queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#invocation-dlq). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--dead_letter_config))
- `description` (String) A description of the function.
- `environment` (Attributes) Environment variables that are accessible from function code during execution. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--environment))
- `ephemeral_storage` (Attributes) The size of the function's ``/tmp`` directory in MB. The default value is 512, but it can be any whole number between 512 and 10,240 MB. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--ephemeral_storage))
- `file_system_configs` (Attributes List) Connection settings for an Amazon EFS file system. To connect a function to a file system, a mount target must be available in every Availability Zone that your function connects to. If your template contains an [AWS::EFS::MountTarget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-efs-mounttarget.html) resource, you must also specify a ``DependsOn`` attribute to ensure that the mount target is created or updated before the function.
 For more information about using the ``DependsOn`` attribute, see [DependsOn Attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-dependson.html). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--file_system_configs))
- `function_name` (String) The name of the Lambda function, up to 64 characters in length. If you don't specify a name, CFN generates one.
 If you specify a name, you cannot perform updates that require replacement of this resource. You can perform updates that require no or some interruption. If you must replace the resource, specify a new name.
- `handler` (String) The name of the method within your code that Lambda calls to run your function. Handler is required if the deployment package is a .zip file archive. The format includes the file name. It can also include namespaces and other qualifiers, depending on the runtime. For more information, see [Lambda programming model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/foundation-progmodel.html).
- `image_config` (Attributes) Configuration values that override the container image Dockerfile settings. For more information, see [Container image settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html#images-parms). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--image_config))
- `kms_key_arn` (String) The ARN of the KMSlong (KMS) customer managed key that's used to encrypt your function's [environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html#configuration-envvars-encryption). When [SnapStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart-security.html) is activated, LAM also uses this key is to encrypt your function's snapshot. If you deploy your function using a container image, LAM also uses this key to encrypt your function when it's deployed. Note that this is not the same key that's used to protect your container image in the ECRlong (ECR). If you don't provide a customer managed key, LAM uses a default service key.
- `layers` (List of String) A list of [function layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html) to add to the function's execution environment. Specify each layer by its ARN, including the version.
- `logging_config` (Attributes) The function's Amazon CloudWatch Logs configuration settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--logging_config))
- `memory_size` (Number) The amount of [memory available to the function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-function-common.html#configuration-memory-console) at runtime. Increasing the function memory also increases its CPU allocation. The default value is 128 MB. The value can be any multiple of 1 MB. Note that new AWS accounts have reduced concurrency and memory quotas. AWS raises these quotas automatically based on your usage. You can also request a quota increase.
- `package_type` (String) The type of deployment package. Set to ``Image`` for container image and set ``Zip`` for .zip file archive.
- `recursive_loop` (String) The status of your function's recursive loop detection configuration.
 When this value is set to ``Allow``and Lambda detects your function being invoked as part of a recursive loop, it doesn't take any action.
 When this value is set to ``Terminate`` and Lambda detects your function being invoked as part of a recursive loop, it stops your function being invoked and notifies you.
- `reserved_concurrent_executions` (Number) The number of simultaneous executions to reserve for the function.
- `runtime` (String) The identifier of the function's [runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html). Runtime is required if the deployment package is a .zip file archive. Specifying a runtime results in an error if you're deploying a function using a container image.
 The following list includes deprecated runtimes. Lambda blocks creating new functions and updating existing functions shortly after each runtime is deprecated. For more information, see [Runtime use after deprecation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html#runtime-deprecation-levels).
 For a list of all currently supported runtimes, see [Supported runtimes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html#runtimes-supported).
- `runtime_management_config` (Attributes) Sets the runtime management configuration for a function's version. For more information, see [Runtime updates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-update.html). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--runtime_management_config))
- `snap_start` (Attributes) The function's [SnapStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html) setting. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--snap_start))
- `tags` (Attributes Set) A list of [tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/tagging.html) to apply to the function.
  You must have the ``lambda:TagResource``, ``lambda:UntagResource``, and ``lambda:ListTags`` permissions for your [principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html) to manage the CFN stack. If you don't have these permissions, there might be unexpected behavior with stack-level tags propagating to the resource during resource creation and update. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
- `timeout` (Number) The amount of time (in seconds) that Lambda allows a function to run before stopping it. The default is 3 seconds. The maximum allowed value is 900 seconds. For more information, see [Lambda execution environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-context.html).
- `tracing_config` (Attributes) Set ``Mode`` to ``Active`` to sample and trace a subset of incoming requests with [X-Ray](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-xray.html). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tracing_config))
- `vpc_config` (Attributes) For network connectivity to AWS resources in a VPC, specify a list of security groups and subnets in the VPC. When you connect a function to a VPC, it can access resources and the internet only through that VPC. For more information, see [Configuring a Lambda function to access resources in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--vpc_config))

### Read-Only

- `arn` (String)
- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `snap_start_response` (Attributes) The function's [SnapStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html) setting. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--snap_start_response))

<a id="nestedatt--code"></a>
### Nested Schema for `code`

Optional:

- `image_uri` (String) URI of a [container image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-images.html) in the Amazon ECR registry.
- `s3_bucket` (String) An Amazon S3 bucket in the same AWS-Region as your function. The bucket can be in a different AWS-account.
- `s3_key` (String) The Amazon S3 key of the deployment package.
- `s3_object_version` (String) For versioned objects, the version of the deployment package object to use.
- `source_kms_key_arn` (String)
- `zip_file` (String) (Node.js and Python) The source code of your Lambda function. If you include your function source inline with this parameter, CFN places it in a file named ``index`` and zips it to create a [deployment package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html). This zip file cannot exceed 4MB. For the ``Handler`` property, the first part of the handler identifier must be ``index``. For example, ``index.handler``.
  For JSON, you must escape quotes and special characters such as newline (``\n``) with a backslash.
 If you specify a function that interacts with an AWS CloudFormation custom resource, you don't have to write your own functions to send responses to the custom resource that invoked the function. AWS CloudFormation provides a response module ([cfn-response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-lambda-function-code-cfnresponsemodule.html)) that simplifies sending responses. See [Using Lambda with CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-cloudformation.html) for details.

- `working_directory` (String) Specifies the working directory. The length of the directory string cannot exceed 1,000 characters.


<a id="nestedatt--logging_config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `logging_config`

Optional:

- `application_log_level` (String) Set this property to filter the application logs for your function that Lambda sends to CloudWatch. Lambda only sends application logs at the selected level of detail and lower, where ``TRACE`` is the highest level and ``FATAL`` is the lowest.

- `log_group` (String) The name of the Amazon CloudWatch log group the function sends logs to. By default, Lambda functions send logs to a default log group named ``/aws/lambda/<function name>``. To use a different log group, enter an existing log group or enter a new log group name.
- `system_log_level` (String) Set this property to filter the system logs for your function that Lambda sends to CloudWatch. Lambda only sends system logs at the selected level of detail and lower, where ``DEBUG`` is the highest level and ``WARN`` is the lowest.


<a id="nestedatt--runtime_management_config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `runtime_management_config`

Optional:

- `runtime_version_arn` (String) The ARN of the runtime version you want the function to use.
  This is only required if you're using the *Manual* runtime update mode.
- `update_runtime_on` (String) Specify the runtime update mode.
  +   *Auto (default)* - Automatically update to the most recent and secure runtime version using a [Two-phase runtime version rollout](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-update.html#runtime-management-two-phase). This is the best choice for most customers to ensure they always benefit from runtime updates.
  +   *FunctionUpdate* - LAM updates the runtime of you function to the most recent and secure runtime version when you update your function. This approach synchronizes runtime updates with function deployments, giving you control over when runtime updates are applied and allowing you to detect and mitigate rare runtime update incompatibilities early. When using this setting, you need to regularly update your functions to keep their runtime up-to-date.
  +   *Manual* - You specify a runtime version in your function configuration. The function will use this runtime version indefinitely. In the rare case where a new runtime version is incompatible with an existing function, this allows you to roll back your function to an earlier runtime version. For more information, see [Roll back a runtime version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-update.html#runtime-management-rollback).
