# awscc_ec2_vpn_connection_route (Resource)

Specifies a static route for a VPN connection between an existing virtual private gateway and a VPN customer gateway. The static route allows traffic to be routed from the virtual private gateway to the VPN customer gateway.
 For more information, see [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html) in the *User Guide*.

## Example Usage

### Create Static Route for VPN Connection

Demonstrates how to create a static route for an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection by specifying the destination CIDR block of the customer network and associating it with a VPN connection.

```terraform
# VPC
resource "awscc_ec2_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Name"
    value = "vpn-route-example"
  }]
}

# Virtual Private Gateway
resource "aws_vpn_gateway" "example" {
  vpc_id = awscc_ec2_vpc.example.vpc_id
  tags = {
    Name = "vpn-route-example"
  }
}

# Customer Gateway
resource "awscc_ec2_customer_gateway" "example" {
  bgp_asn    = 65000
  ip_address = "203.0.113.1" # Example IP address
  type       = "ipsec.1"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Name"
    value = "vpn-route-example"
  }]
}

# VPN Connection
resource "aws_vpn_connection" "example" {
  customer_gateway_id = awscc_ec2_customer_gateway.example.id
  type                = "ipsec.1"
  vpn_gateway_id      = aws_vpn_gateway.example.id
  static_routes_only  = true
  tags = {
    Name = "vpn-route-example"
  }
}

# VPN Connection Route
resource "aws_vpn_connection_route" "example" {
  destination_cidr_block = "172.16.0.0/24" # Example customer network CIDR
  vpn_connection_id      = aws_vpn_connection.example.id
}

## Schema

### Required

- `destination_cidr_block` (String) The CIDR block associated with the local subnet of the customer network.
- `vpn_connection_id` (String) The ID of the VPN connection.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_vpn_connection_route.example
  id = "destination_cidr_block|vpn_connection_id"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_ec2_vpn_connection_route.example "destination_cidr_block|vpn_connection_id"
```
