Resource schema for AWS::DataSync::Task.

## Example Usage

### Configure S3 to S3 DataSync Task

Creates an AWS DataSync task that synchronizes data between two S3 buckets with weekly schedule, along with necessary IAM roles, policies, and CloudWatch logging configuration.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_datasync_task.example
  id = "task_arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_datasync_task.example "task_arn"
```
