### Optional

- `configuration_properties` (Attributes Set) The configuration properties for the custom action. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration_properties))
- `settings` (Attributes) URLs that provide users information about this custom action. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--settings))
