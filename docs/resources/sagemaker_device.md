# awscc_sagemaker_device (Resource)

Resource schema for AWS::SageMaker::Device

## Example Usage

### Register SageMaker Edge Device

Creates a SageMaker edge device registration within a device fleet, associating it with an IoT thing name and providing device-specific metadata for edge computing capabilities.

```terraform
# Create a SageMaker Device
resource "awscc_sagemaker_device" "example" {
  device_fleet_name = "my-device-fleet"

  device = {
    device_name    = "my-edge-device"
    description    = "Example edge device for SageMaker"
    iot_thing_name = "my-iot-thing"
  }

  tags = [{
    key   = "Environment"
    value = "Production"
    }, {
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_sagemaker_device.example
  identity = {
    device_device_name = "device_device_name"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `device_device_name` (String)

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The ID of the AWS account
- `region` (String) The AWS region where the resource is located

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_sagemaker_device.example
  id = "device_device_name"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_sagemaker_device.example "device_device_name"
```
