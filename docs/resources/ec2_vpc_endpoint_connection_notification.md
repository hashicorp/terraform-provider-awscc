# awscc_ec2_vpc_endpoint_connection_notification (Resource)

Resource Type definition for AWS::EC2::VPCEndpointConnectionNotification

## Example Usage

### VPC Endpoint Connection Notification with SNS

Creates a VPC endpoint connection notification that listens for Accept and Reject events and publishes them to an SNS topic, with necessary IAM permissions to allow vpce.amazonaws.com to publish to the topic.

~> This example is generated by LLM using Amazon Bedrock and validated using terraform validate, apply and destroy. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date. We recommend independently verifying the content.

```terraform
data "aws_region" "current" {}

# Create an SNS topic
resource "awscc_sns_topic" "notification" {
  topic_name = "vpc-endpoint-notifications"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

# SNS Topic Policy
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "notification" {
  statement {
    effect = "Allow"
    actions = [
      "SNS:Publish"
    ]
    principals {
      type        = "Service"
      identifiers = ["vpce.amazonaws.com"]
    }
    resources = [awscc_sns_topic.notification.topic_arn]
  }
}

resource "aws_sns_topic_policy" "notification" {
  arn    = awscc_sns_topic.notification.topic_arn
  policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.notification.json
}

resource "awscc_ec2_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

resource "awscc_ec2_vpc_endpoint" "example" {
  service_name      = "com.amazonaws.${data.aws_region.current.name}.s3"
  vpc_id            = awscc_ec2_vpc.main.id
  vpc_endpoint_type = "Interface"
}

resource "awscc_ec2_vpc_endpoint_connection_notification" "example" {
  connection_notification_arn = awscc_sns_topic.notification.topic_arn
  vpc_endpoint_id             = awscc_ec2_vpc_endpoint.example.id
  connection_events           = ["Accept", "Reject"]
}

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_vpc_endpoint_connection_notification.example
  id = "vpc_endpoint_connection_notification_id"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_ec2_vpc_endpoint_connection_notification.example "vpc_endpoint_connection_notification_id"
```
