  Specifies a route in a route table. For more information, see Routes https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html#route-table-routes in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
  You must specify either a destination CIDR block or prefix list ID. You must also specify exactly one of the resources as the target.
  If you create a route that references a transit gateway in the same template where you create the transit gateway, you must declare a dependency on the transit gateway attachment.

# awscc_ec2_route (Resource)

Specifies a route in a route table. For more information, see [Routes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html#route-table-routes) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.
 You must specify either a destination CIDR block or prefix list ID. You must also specify exactly one of the resources as the target.
 If you create a route that references a transit gateway in the same template where you create the transit gateway, you must declare a dependency on the transit gateway attachment. The route table cannot use the transit gateway until it has successfully attached to the VPC. Add a [DependsOn Attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-dependson.html) in the ``AWS::EC2::Route`` resource to explicitly declare a dependency on the ``AWS::EC2::TransitGatewayAttachment`` resource.

## Example Usage

### Configure Internet Access Route

To configure internet access for a VPC by creating a route in a route table that directs all outbound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) through an Internet Gateway.

```terraform
# Create VPC
resource "awscc_ec2_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block           = "10.0.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  enable_dns_support   = true
  tags = [{
    key   = "Name"
    value = "example-vpc"
  }]
}

# Create Internet Gateway
resource "awscc_ec2_internet_gateway" "example" {
  tags = [{
    key   = "Name"
    value = "example-igw"
  }]
}

# Attach Internet Gateway to VPC
resource "awscc_ec2_vpc_gateway_attachment" "example" {
  vpc_id              = awscc_ec2_vpc.example.id
  internet_gateway_id = awscc_ec2_internet_gateway.example.id
}

# Create Route Table
resource "awscc_ec2_route_table" "example" {
  vpc_id = awscc_ec2_vpc.example.id
  tags = [{
    key   = "Name"
    value = "example-rt"
  }]
}

# Create Route
resource "awscc_ec2_route" "example" {
  route_table_id         = awscc_ec2_route_table.example.id
  destination_cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
  gateway_id             = awscc_ec2_internet_gateway.example.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `route_table_id` (String) The ID of the route table for the route.

### Optional

- `carrier_gateway_id` (String) The ID of the carrier gateway.
 You can only use this option when the VPC contains a subnet which is associated with a Wavelength Zone.
- `core_network_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the core network.
- `destination_cidr_block` (String) The IPv4 CIDR address block used for the destination match. Routing decisions are based on the most specific match. We modify the specified CIDR block to its canonical form; for example, if you specify ``100.68.0.18/18``, we modify it to ``100.68.0.0/18``.
- `destination_ipv_6_cidr_block` (String) The IPv6 CIDR block used for the destination match. Routing decisions are based on the most specific match.
- `destination_prefix_list_id` (String) The ID of a prefix list used for the destination match.
- `egress_only_internet_gateway_id` (String) [IPv6 traffic only] The ID of an egress-only internet gateway.
- `gateway_id` (String) The ID of an internet gateway or virtual private gateway attached to your VPC.
- `instance_id` (String) The ID of a NAT instance in your VPC. The operation fails if you specify an instance ID unless exactly one network interface is attached.
- `local_gateway_id` (String) The ID of the local gateway.
- `nat_gateway_id` (String) [IPv4 traffic only] The ID of a NAT gateway.
- `network_interface_id` (String) The ID of a network interface.
- `transit_gateway_id` (String) The ID of a transit gateway.
- `vpc_endpoint_id` (String) The ID of a VPC endpoint. Supported for Gateway Load Balancer endpoints only.
- `vpc_peering_connection_id` (String) The ID of a VPC peering connection.

### Read-Only

- `cidr_block` (String)
- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_route.example
  identity = {
    route_table_id = "route_table_id"
    cidr_block     = "cidr_block"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `cidr_block` (String)
- `route_table_id` (String) The ID of the route table for the route

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The ID of the AWS account
- `region` (String) The AWS region where the resource is located

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_route.example
  id = "route_table_id|cidr_block"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_ec2_route.example "route_table_id|cidr_block"
```
