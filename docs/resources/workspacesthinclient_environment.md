Resource type definition for AWS::WorkSpacesThinClient::Environment.

## Example Usage

### Configure WorkSpaces ThinClient Environment

Creates a WorkSpaces ThinClient environment with custom maintenance window scheduled for Mondays between 2-4 AM UTC, utilizing the latest software updates and applying them during the maintenance window.

```terraform
# Get the current AWS region
# Note: Using data.aws_region.current.region (AWS provider v6.0+)
# For AWS provider < v6.0, use data.aws_region.current.name instead
data "aws_region" "current" {}

# Get the current AWS account ID
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

# Create a WorkSpaces ThinClient Environment
resource "awscc_workspacesthinclient_environment" "example" {
  name        = "example-thinclient-env"
  desktop_arn = "arn:aws:workspaces:${data.aws_region.current.region}:${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:workspace/ws-abcd1234"
