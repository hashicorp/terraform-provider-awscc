```terraform
# Create a Route53 Recovery Readiness Cell
resource "awscc_route53recoveryreadiness_cell" "example" {
  cell_name = "my-recovery-cell"

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]

## Schema

### Optional

- `cell_name` (String) The name of the cell to create.
- `cells` (List of String) A list of cell Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) contained within this cell, for use in nested cells. For example, Availability Zones within specific Regions.
- `tags` (Attributes List) A collection of tags associated with a resource (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))

### Read-Only

- `cell_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cell.
- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `parent_readiness_scopes` (List of String) The readiness scope for the cell, which can be a cell Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or a recovery group ARN. This is a list but currently can have only one element.

### Nested Schema for `tags`

Optional:

- `key` (String)
- `value` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_route53recoveryreadiness_cell.example
  identity = {
    cell_name = "cell_name"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `cell_name` (String) The name of the cell to create

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The ID of the AWS account

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_route53recoveryreadiness_cell.example
  id = "cell_name"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_route53recoveryreadiness_cell.example "cell_name"
```
