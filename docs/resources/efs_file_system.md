# awscc_efs_file_system (Resource)

The ``AWS::EFS::FileSystem`` resource creates a new, empty file system in EFSlong (EFS). You must create a mount target ([AWS::EFS::MountTarget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-efs-mounttarget.html)) to mount your EFS file system on an EC2 or other AWS cloud compute resource.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage
To create a simple EFS File System
```terraform
resource "awscc_efs_file_system" "this" {

  file_system_tags = [
    {
      key   = "Name"
      value = "this"
    },
    {
      key   = "Modified By"
      value = "AWSCC"
    }
  ]
}
```

To create a EFS File System with lifecycle policies
```terraform
resource "awscc_efs_file_system" "this" {
  lifecycle_policies = [{
    transition_to_ia = "AFTER_30_DAYS"
  }]

  file_system_tags = [
    {
      key   = "Name"
      value = "this"
    },
    {
      key   = "Modified By"
      value = "AWSCC"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Advanced Usage
To create a EFS File System with KMS based encryption
```terraform
resource "awscc_efs_file_system" "this" {
  encrypted  = true
  kms_key_id = "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/b1d4919e-3296-4104-a3a8-c9f3b1138fa8"

  file_system_tags = [
    {
      key   = "Name"
      value = "this"
    },
    {
      key   = "Modified By"
      value = "AWSCC"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `availability_zone_name` (String) For One Zone file systems, specify the AWS Availability Zone in which to create the file system. Use the format ``us-east-1a`` to specify the Availability Zone. For more information about One Zone file systems, see [EFS file system types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/availability-durability.html#file-system-type) in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*.
  One Zone file systems are not available in all Availability Zones in AWS-Regions where Amazon EFS is available.
- `backup_policy` (Attributes) Use the ``BackupPolicy`` to turn automatic backups on or off for the file system. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--backup_policy))
- `bypass_policy_lockout_safety_check` (Boolean) (Optional) A boolean that specifies whether or not to bypass the ``FileSystemPolicy`` lockout safety check. The lockout safety check determines whether the policy in the request will lock out, or prevent, the IAM principal that is making the request from making future ``PutFileSystemPolicy`` requests on this file system. Set ``BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck`` to ``True`` only when you intend to prevent the IAM principal that is making the request from making subsequent ``PutFileSystemPolicy`` requests on this file system. The default value is ``False``.
- `encrypted` (Boolean) A Boolean value that, if true, creates an encrypted file system. When creating an encrypted file system, you have the option of specifying a KmsKeyId for an existing kms-key-long. If you don't specify a kms-key, then the default kms-key for EFS, ``/aws/elasticfilesystem``, is used to protect the encrypted file system.
- `file_system_policy` (String) The ``FileSystemPolicy`` for the EFS file system. A file system policy is an IAM resource policy used to control NFS access to an EFS file system. For more information, see [Using to control NFS access to Amazon EFS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/iam-access-control-nfs-efs.html) in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*.
- `file_system_protection` (Attributes) Describes the protection on the file system. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--file_system_protection))
- `file_system_tags` (Attributes List) Use to create one or more tags associated with the file system. Each tag is a user-defined key-value pair. Name your file system on creation by including a ``"Key":"Name","Value":"{value}"`` key-value pair. Each key must be unique. For more information, see [Tagging resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in the *General Reference Guide*. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--file_system_tags))
- `kms_key_id` (String) The ID of the kms-key-long to be used to protect the encrypted file system. This parameter is only required if you want to use a nondefault kms-key. If this parameter is not specified, the default kms-key for EFS is used. This ID can be in one of the following formats:
  +  Key ID - A unique identifier of the key, for example ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``.
  +  ARN - An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the key, for example ``arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``.
  +  Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for example ``alias/projectKey1``.
  +  Key alias ARN - An ARN for a key alias, for example ``arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1``.
  
 If ``KmsKeyId`` is specified, the ``Encrypted`` parameter must be set to true.
- `lifecycle_policies` (Attributes List) An array of ``LifecyclePolicy`` objects that define the file system's ``LifecycleConfiguration`` object. A ``LifecycleConfiguration`` object informs Lifecycle management of the following:
  +  When to move files in the file system from primary storage to IA storage.
  +  When to move files in the file system from primary storage or IA storage to Archive storage.
  +  When to move files that are in IA or Archive storage to primary storage.
  
  EFS requires that each ``LifecyclePolicy`` object have only a single transition. This means that in a request body, ``LifecyclePolicies`` needs to be structured as an array of ``LifecyclePolicy`` objects, one object for each transition, ``TransitionToIA``, ``TransitionToArchive````TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass``. See the example requests in the following section for more information. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--lifecycle_policies))
- `performance_mode` (String) The performance mode of the file system. We recommend ``generalPurpose`` performance mode for all file systems. File systems using the ``maxIO`` performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the file system has been created. The ``maxIO`` mode is not supported on One Zone file systems.
  Due to the higher per-operation latencies with Max I/O, we recommend using General Purpose performance mode for all file systems.
  Default is ``generalPurpose``.
- `provisioned_throughput_in_mibps` (Number) The throughput, measured in mebibytes per second (MiBps), that you want to provision for a file system that you're creating. Required if ``ThroughputMode`` is set to ``provisioned``. Valid values are 1-3414 MiBps, with the upper limit depending on Region. To increase this limit, contact SUP. For more information, see [Amazon EFS quotas that you can increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/limits.html#soft-limits) in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*.
- `replication_configuration` (Attributes) Describes the replication configuration for a specific file system. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--replication_configuration))
- `throughput_mode` (String) Specifies the throughput mode for the file system. The mode can be ``bursting``, ``provisioned``, or ``elastic``. If you set ``ThroughputMode`` to ``provisioned``, you must also set a value for ``ProvisionedThroughputInMibps``. After you create the file system, you can decrease your file system's Provisioned throughput or change between the throughput modes, with certain time restrictions. For more information, see [Specifying throughput with provisioned mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#provisioned-throughput) in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*. 
 Default is ``bursting``.

  +  ``DISABLED`` ? The file system can be used as the destination file system in a replication configuration. The file system is read-only and can only be modified by EFS replication.
  +  ``REPLICATING`` ? The file system is being used as the destination file system in a replication configuration. The file system is read-only and is modified only by EFS replication.
