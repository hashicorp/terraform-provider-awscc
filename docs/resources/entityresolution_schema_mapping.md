SchemaMapping defined in AWS Entity Resolution service

## Example Usage

### Entity Resolution Schema Mapping for Customer Data

Creates an Entity Resolution schema mapping that defines how customer data fields (ID, name, email, and address) are mapped and matched, with email being hashed for security and address grouped under contact information.

```terraform
resource "awscc_entityresolution_schema_mapping" "example" {
  schema_name = "example-schema-mapping"
  description = "Example schema mapping for customer data"

  mapped_input_fields = [
    {
      field_name = "id"
      type       = "UNIQUE_ID"
    },
    {
      field_name = "name"
      type       = "NAME"
      match_key  = "NAME"
    },
    {
      field_name = "email"
      type       = "EMAIL_ADDRESS"
      match_key  = "EMAIL"
      hashed     = true
    },
    {
      field_name = "address"
      type       = "ADDRESS"
      match_key  = "ADDRESS"
      group_name = "contact"
    }
  ]

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```

- `schema_name` (String) The name of the SchemaMapping

### Optional

- `description` (String) The description of the SchemaMapping
- `tags` (Attributes Set) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The time of this SchemaMapping got created
- `has_workflows` (Boolean) The boolean value that indicates whether or not a SchemaMapping has MatchingWorkflows that are associated with

### Nested Schema for `mapped_input_fields`

Required:

- `type` (String)

Optional:

- `group_name` (String)
- `hashed` (Boolean)
- `match_key` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_entityresolution_schema_mapping.example
  identity = {
    schema_name = "schema_name"
  }
}
```

### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `schema_name` (String) The name of the SchemaMapping

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The ID of the AWS account
- `region` (String) The AWS region where the resource is located

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_entityresolution_schema_mapping.example
  id = "schema_name"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_entityresolution_schema_mapping.example "schema_name"
```
