# awscc_connect_routing_profile (Resource)

Resource Type definition for AWS::Connect::RoutingProfile

## Example Usage

### Connect Routing Profile with Task Queue

Creates an Amazon Connect routing profile with a task queue configuration, including necessary dependencies like Connect instance, hours of operation, and a task queue with 24/7 Monday operation.
