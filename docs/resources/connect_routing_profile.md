# awscc_connect_routing_profile (Resource)

Resource Type definition for AWS::Connect::RoutingProfile

## Example Usage

### Connect Routing Profile with Task Queue

Creates an Amazon Connect routing profile with a task queue configuration, including necessary dependencies like Connect instance, hours of operation, and a task queue with 24/7 Monday operation.

```terraform

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_connect_routing_profile.example
  identity = {
    routing_profile_arn = "routing_profile_arn"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `routing_profile_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the routing profile

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The ID of the AWS account
- `region` (String) The AWS region where the resource is located

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_connect_routing_profile.example
  id = "routing_profile_arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_connect_routing_profile.example "routing_profile_arn"
```
