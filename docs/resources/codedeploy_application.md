## Schema

### Optional

- `application_name` (String) A name for the application. If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the application name.
- `compute_platform` (String) The compute platform that CodeDeploy deploys the application to.
- `tags` (Attributes List) The metadata that you apply to CodeDeploy applications to help you organize and categorize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

<a id="nestedatt--tags"></a>
### Nested Schema for `tags`

Optional:

- `key` (String)
- `value` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_codedeploy_application.example "application_name"
```
