~> This example is generated by LLM using Amazon Bedrock and validated using terraform validate, apply and destroy. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date. We recommend independently verifying the content.

```terraform
# Create CodeDeploy Application
resource "awscc_codedeploy_application" "example" {
  application_name = "example-application"
  compute_platform = "Server" # Valid values: Server, Lambda, or ECS

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `application_name` (String) A name for the application. If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the application name.
- `compute_platform` (String) The compute platform that CodeDeploy deploys the application to.
- `tags` (Attributes List) The metadata that you apply to CodeDeploy applications to help you organize and categorize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

<a id="nestedatt--tags"></a>
### Nested Schema for `tags`

Optional:

- `key` (String)
- `value` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_codedeploy_application.example
  identity = {
    application_name = "application_name"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `application_name` (String) A name for the application

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed
- `region` (String) Region where this resource is managed

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_codedeploy_application.example
  id = "application_name"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_codedeploy_application.example "application_name"
```
