# awscc_securityhub_insight (Resource)

The AWS::SecurityHub::Insight resource represents the AWS Security Hub Insight in your account. An AWS Security Hub insight is a collection of related findings.

## Example Usage

### SecurityHub Insight for High Severity Findings

Creates a SecurityHub insight that groups high-severity findings by ResourceId from the last 30 days, filtering for active and new findings in the current AWS account and region.
