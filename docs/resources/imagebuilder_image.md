- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `image_id` (String) The AMI ID of the EC2 AMI in current region.

### Nested Schema for `image_pipeline_execution_settings`

Optional:

- `deployment_id` (String) The deployment ID of the pipeline, used to trigger new image pipeline executions.
- `on_update` (Boolean) Whether to trigger the image pipeline when the pipeline is updated. False by default.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_imagebuilder_image.example
  identity = {
    arn = "arn"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed
- `region` (String) Region where this resource is managed

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_imagebuilder_image.example
  id = "arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_imagebuilder_image.example "arn"
```
