```terraform

  description = "Example Verified Access Instance"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

# Create a Trust Provider
resource "aws_verifiedaccess_trust_provider" "example" {

  trust_provider_type   = "user"

  tags = {
    Modified_By = "AWSCC"
  }

  user_trust_provider_type = "iam-identity-center"

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_verified_access_group.example
  identity = {
    verified_access_group_id = "verified_access_group_id"
