# awscc_iotfleetwise_model_manifest (Resource)

Definition of AWS::IoTFleetWise::ModelManifest Resource Type

## Example Usage

### IoT FleetWise Model Manifest with Signal Catalog

Creates an IoT FleetWise model manifest that references a signal catalog containing vehicle speed data, configured with an ACTIVE status and appropriate tagging for AWS fleet management.

~> This example is generated by LLM using Amazon Bedrock and validated using terraform validate, apply and destroy. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date. We recommend independently verifying the content.

```terraform
# First create a signal catalog which is required for model manifest
resource "awscc_iotfleetwise_signal_catalog" "example" {
  name        = "example-signal-catalog"
  description = "Example signal catalog for model manifest"
  nodes = [
    {
      branch = {
        fully_qualified_name = "Vehicle"
        description          = "Vehicle branch"
      }
    },
    {
      sensor = {
        fully_qualified_name = "Vehicle.Speed"
        data_type            = "DOUBLE"
        description          = "Vehicle Speed in km/h"
        unit                 = "km/h"
      }
    }
  ]

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

# Create the model manifest
resource "awscc_iotfleetwise_model_manifest" "example" {
  name               = "example-model-manifest"
  description        = "Example model manifest"
  signal_catalog_arn = awscc_iotfleetwise_signal_catalog.example.arn
  nodes = [
    "Vehicle.Speed"
  ]
  status = "ACTIVE"

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_iotfleetwise_model_manifest.example
  identity = {
    name = "name"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `name` (String)

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The ID of the AWS account
- `region` (String) The AWS region where the resource is located

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_iotfleetwise_model_manifest.example
  id = "name"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_iotfleetwise_model_manifest.example "name"
```
