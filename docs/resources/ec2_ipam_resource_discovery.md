## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_ipam_resource_discovery.example
  identity = {
    ipam_resource_discovery_id = "ipam_resource_discovery_id"
  }
}
```

### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `ipam_resource_discovery_id` (String) Id of the IPAM Pool

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The ID of the AWS account
- `region` (String) The AWS region where the resource is located

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_ipam_resource_discovery.example
  id = "ipam_resource_discovery_id"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_ec2_ipam_resource_discovery.example "ipam_resource_discovery_id"
```
