### Create Carrier Gateway with VPC

To create an AWS Carrier Gateway, this example demonstrates the setup of a carrier gateway attached to a new VPC with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16.

~> This example is generated by LLM using Amazon Bedrock and validated using terraform validate, apply and destroy. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date. We recommend independently verifying the content.

```terraform
# Create a VPC for the carrier gateway
resource "awscc_ec2_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

# Create the carrier gateway
resource "awscc_ec2_carrier_gateway" "example" {
  vpc_id = awscc_ec2_vpc.example.id
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_carrier_gateway.example
  identity = {
    carrier_gateway_id = "carrier_gateway_id"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `carrier_gateway_id` (String) The ID of the carrier gateway

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The ID of the AWS account
- `region` (String) The AWS region where the resource is located

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_carrier_gateway.example
  id = "carrier_gateway_id"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_ec2_carrier_gateway.example "carrier_gateway_id"
```
