# awscc_redshift_integration (Resource)

Integration from a source AWS service to a Redshift cluster

## Example Usage

### Configure Aurora to Redshift Integration

Creates a data integration between an Aurora source cluster and a Redshift target cluster, enabling seamless data transfer between the two services with optional encryption support.

~> This example is generated by LLM using Amazon Bedrock and validated using terraform validate, apply and destroy. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date. We recommend independently verifying the content.

```terraform
# Get current AWS region
data "aws_region" "current" {}

# Get current AWS account ID
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

# Example of an Redshift integration configuration
# Note: The source and target clusters must already exist
resource "awscc_redshift_integration" "example" {
  # ARN of the source Aurora cluster
  source_arn = "arn:aws:rds:${data.aws_region.current.name}:${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:cluster:example-aurora-cluster"

  # ARN of the target Redshift cluster
  target_arn = "arn:aws:redshift:${data.aws_region.current.name}:${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:cluster:example-redshift-cluster"

  # Name for the integration
  integration_name = "aurora-to-redshift"

  # Optional: KMS key for encryption (uncomment and provide key ID if needed)
  # kms_key_id = "arn:aws:kms:region:account:key/key-id"

  # Optional: Additional encryption context
  # additional_encryption_context = {
  #   "Environment" = "Production"
  # }

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `source_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the database to use as the source for replication
- `target_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Redshift data warehouse to use as the target for replication

### Optional

- `additional_encryption_context` (Map of String) An optional set of non-secret keyâ€“value pairs that contains additional contextual information about the data.
- `integration_name` (String) The name of the integration.
- `kms_key_id` (String) An KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the integration. If you don't specify an encryption key, the default AWS owned KMS key is used.
- `tags` (Attributes Set) An array of key-value pairs to apply to this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))

### Read-Only

- `create_time` (String) The time (UTC) when the integration was created.
- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `integration_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the integration.

### Nested Schema for `tags`

Optional:

- `key` (String) The key name of the tag. You can specify a value that is 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length and cannot be prefixed with aws:. You can use any of the following characters: the set of Unicode letters, digits, whitespace, _, ., /, =, +, and -.
- `value` (String) The value for the tag. You can specify a value that is 0 to 256 Unicode characters in length and cannot be prefixed with aws:. You can use any of the following characters: the set of Unicode letters, digits, whitespace, _, ., /, =, +, and -.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_redshift_integration.example
  identity = {
    integration_arn = "integration_arn"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `integration_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the integration

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The ID of the AWS account
- `region` (String) The AWS region where the resource is located

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_redshift_integration.example
  id = "integration_arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_redshift_integration.example "integration_arn"
```
