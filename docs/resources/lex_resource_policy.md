## Schema

### Required

- `policy` (String) A resource policy to add to the resource. The policy is a JSON structure following the IAM syntax that contains one or more statements that define the policy.
- `resource_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bot or bot alias that the resource policy is attached to.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `resource_policy_id` (String) The Physical ID of the resource policy.
- `revision_id` (String) The current revision of the resource policy. Use the revision ID to make sure that you are updating the most current version of a resource policy when you add a policy statement to a resource, delete a resource, or update a resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_lex_resource_policy.example
  id = "id"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_lex_resource_policy.example "id"
```
