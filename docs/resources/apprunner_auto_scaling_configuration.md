# awscc_apprunner_auto_scaling_configuration (Resource)

Describes an AWS App Runner automatic configuration resource that enables automatic scaling of instances used to process web requests. You can share an auto scaling configuration across multiple services.

## Example Usage

### Configure App Runner Auto Scaling

Creates an App Runner auto scaling configuration that manages concurrent requests between 1 and 10 instances with a maximum of 100 concurrent requests.

~> This example is generated by LLM using Amazon Bedrock and validated using terraform validate, apply and destroy. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date. We recommend independently verifying the content.

```terraform
# Basic App Runner Auto Scaling configuration
resource "awscc_apprunner_auto_scaling_configuration" "example" {
  auto_scaling_configuration_name = "example-autoscaling-config"
  max_concurrency                 = 100
  max_size                        = 10
  min_size                        = 1

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `auto_scaling_configuration_name` (String) The customer-provided auto scaling configuration name.  When you use it for the first time in an AWS Region, App Runner creates revision number 1 of this name. When you use the same name in subsequent calls, App Runner creates incremental revisions of the configuration. The auto scaling configuration name can be used in multiple revisions of a configuration.
- `max_concurrency` (Number) The maximum number of concurrent requests that an instance processes. If the number of concurrent requests exceeds this limit, App Runner scales the service up to use more instances to process the requests.
- `max_size` (Number) The maximum number of instances that an App Runner service scales up to. At most MaxSize instances actively serve traffic for your service.
- `min_size` (Number) The minimum number of instances that App Runner provisions for a service. The service always has at least MinSize provisioned instances. Some of them actively serve traffic. The rest of them (provisioned and inactive instances) are a cost-effective compute capacity reserve and are ready to be quickly activated. You pay for memory usage of all the provisioned instances. You pay for CPU usage of only the active subset.
- `tags` (Attributes List) A list of metadata items that you can associate with your auto scaling configuration resource. A tag is a key-value pair. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))

### Read-Only

- `auto_scaling_configuration_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this auto scaling configuration.
- `auto_scaling_configuration_revision` (Number) The revision of this auto scaling configuration. It's unique among all the active configurations ("Status": "ACTIVE") that share the same AutoScalingConfigurationName.
- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `latest` (Boolean) It's set to true for the configuration with the highest Revision among all configurations that share the same AutoScalingConfigurationName. It's set to false otherwise. App Runner temporarily doubles the number of provisioned instances during deployments, to maintain the same capacity for both old and new code.

### Nested Schema for `tags`

Optional:

- `key` (String)
- `value` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_apprunner_auto_scaling_configuration.example
  identity = {
    auto_scaling_configuration_arn = "auto_scaling_configuration_arn"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `auto_scaling_configuration_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this auto scaling configuration

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed
- `region` (String) Region where this resource is managed

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_apprunner_auto_scaling_configuration.example
  id = "auto_scaling_configuration_arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_apprunner_auto_scaling_configuration.example "auto_scaling_configuration_arn"
```
