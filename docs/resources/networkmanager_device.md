# awscc_networkmanager_device (Resource)

The AWS::NetworkManager::Device type describes a device.

## Example Usage

### Network Manager Device Registration

To register a hardware device in AWS Network Manager, configure the device properties including model, vendor, serial number, and geographical location within a global network.

~> This example is generated by LLM using Amazon Bedrock and validated using terraform validate, apply and destroy. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date. We recommend independently verifying the content.

```terraform
# Create a global network first
resource "awscc_networkmanager_global_network" "example" {
  description = "Example Global Network for Device"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

# Create a network manager device
resource "awscc_networkmanager_device" "example" {
  global_network_id = awscc_networkmanager_global_network.example.id
  description       = "Example Network Manager Device"
  model             = "example-model"
  serial_number     = "123456789"
  type              = "HARDWARE"
  vendor            = "Example Vendor"

  location = {
    address   = "123 Example Street"
    latitude  = "47.6062"
    longitude = "-122.3321"
  }

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_networkmanager_device.example
  identity = {
    global_network_id = "global_network_id"
    device_id         = "device_id"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `device_id` (String) The ID of the device
- `global_network_id` (String) The ID of the global network

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_networkmanager_device.example
  id = "global_network_id|device_id"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_networkmanager_device.example "global_network_id|device_id"
```
