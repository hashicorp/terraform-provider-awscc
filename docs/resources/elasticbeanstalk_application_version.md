# awscc_elasticbeanstalk_application_version (Resource)

Resource Type definition for AWS::ElasticBeanstalk::ApplicationVersion

## Example Usage

### Deploy Elastic Beanstalk Application Version

Creates an Elastic Beanstalk application version by uploading application source code to S3 and configuring necessary S3 bucket permissions for Elastic Beanstalk service access.

~> This example is generated by LLM using Amazon Bedrock and validated using terraform validate, apply and destroy. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date. We recommend independently verifying the content.

```terraform
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}
# Note: Using data.aws_region.current.region (AWS provider v6.0+)
# For AWS provider < v6.0, use data.aws_region.current.name instead
data "aws_region" "current" {}

# Create an S3 bucket for the application source
resource "awscc_s3_bucket" "app_bucket" {
  bucket_name = "beanstalk-app-source-${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}-${data.aws_region.current.region}"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

# Policy to allow ElasticBeanstalk to access the S3 bucket
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "allow_beanstalk" {
  statement {
    effect = "Allow"
    principals {
      type        = "Service"
      identifiers = ["elasticbeanstalk.amazonaws.com"]
    }
    actions = [
      "s3:GetObject",
      "s3:GetObjectVersion"
    ]
    resources = [
      "arn:aws:s3:::${awscc_s3_bucket.app_bucket.id}/*"
    ]
  }
}

# Attach the bucket policy
resource "awscc_s3_bucket_policy" "app_bucket_policy" {
  bucket          = awscc_s3_bucket.app_bucket.id
  policy_document = jsonencode(data.aws_iam_policy_document.allow_beanstalk.json)
}

# Create a sample application file
resource "aws_s3_object" "app_source" {
  bucket = awscc_s3_bucket.app_bucket.id
  key    = "sample-app.zip"
  source = "sample-app.zip"
}

# Create the Elastic Beanstalk application
resource "awscc_elasticbeanstalk_application" "example" {
  application_name = "example-app"
  description      = "Example Elastic Beanstalk Application"
}

# Create the application version
resource "awscc_elasticbeanstalk_application_version" "example" {
  application_name = awscc_elasticbeanstalk_application.example.application_name
  description      = "Example Application Version"
  source_bundle = {
    s3_bucket = awscc_s3_bucket.app_bucket.id
    s3_key    = aws_s3_object.app_source.key
  }
}
```
