# awscc_applicationautoscaling_scalable_target (Resource)

The ``AWS::ApplicationAutoScaling::ScalableTarget`` resource specifies a resource that Application Auto Scaling can scale, such as an AWS::DynamoDB::Table or AWS::ECS::Service resource.
 For more information, see [Getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/getting-started.html) in the *Application Auto Scaling User Guide*.
  If the resource that you want Application Auto Scaling to scale is not yet created in your account, add a dependency on the resource when registering it as a scalable target using the [DependsOn](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-dependson.html) attribute.

## Example Usage

### DynamoDB Table Autoscaling

```terraform
resource "awscc_applicationautoscaling_scalable_target" "example" {
  max_capacity       = 100
  min_capacity       = 5
  resource_id        = "table/${var.dynamodb_table_name}"
  scalable_dimension = "dynamodb:table:WriteCapacityUnits"
  service_namespace  = "dynamodb"
}

variable "dynamodb_table_name" {
  type = string
}
```

### DynamoDB Index Autoscaling

```terraform
resource "awscc_applicationautoscaling_scalable_target" "example" {
  max_capacity       = 100
  min_capacity       = 5
  resource_id        = "table/${var.dynamodb_table_name}/index/${var.index_name}"
  scalable_dimension = "dynamodb:index:ReadCapacityUnits"
  service_namespace  = "dynamodb"
}

variable "dynamodb_table_name" {
  type = string
}

variable "index_name" {
  type = string
}
```

### Keyspaces Autoscaling

```terraform
resource "awscc_applicationautoscaling_scalable_target" "example" {
  max_capacity       = 20
  min_capacity       = 1
  resource_id        = "keyspace/example/table/${awscc_cassandra_table.example.table_name}"
  scalable_dimension = "cassandra:table:WriteCapacityUnits"
  service_namespace  = "cassandra"
  depends_on         = [awscc_cassandra_table.example]

    }
  }

}

### Optional

- `role_arn` (String) Specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows Application Auto Scaling to modify the scalable target on your behalf. This can be either an IAM service role that Application Auto Scaling can assume to make calls to other AWS resources on your behalf, or a service-linked role for the specified service. For more information, see [How Application Auto Scaling works with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html) in the *Application Auto Scaling User Guide*.
 To automatically create a service-linked role (recommended), specify the full ARN of the service-linked role in your stack template. To find the exact ARN of the service-linked role for your AWS or custom resource, see the [Service-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-service-linked-roles.html) topic in the *Application Auto Scaling User Guide*. Look for the ARN in the table at the bottom of the page.
- `scheduled_actions` (Attributes Set) The scheduled actions for the scalable target. Duplicates aren't allowed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--scheduled_actions))
- `suspended_state` (Attributes) An embedded object that contains attributes and attribute values that are used to suspend and resume automatic scaling. Setting the value of an attribute to ``true`` suspends the specified scaling activities. Setting it to ``false`` (default) resumes the specified scaling activities. 
  *Suspension Outcomes* 
  +  For ``DynamicScalingInSuspended``, while a suspension is in effect, all scale-in activities that are triggered by a scaling policy are suspended.
  +  For ``DynamicScalingOutSuspended``, while a suspension is in effect, all scale-out activities that are triggered by a scaling policy are suspended.
  +  For ``ScheduledScalingSuspended``, while a suspension is in effect, all scaling activities that involve scheduled actions are suspended. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--suspended_state))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `scalable_target_id` (String)

<a id="nestedatt--scheduled_actions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `scheduled_actions`

Optional:

- `end_time` (String) The date and time that the action is scheduled to end, in UTC.
- `scalable_target_action` (Attributes) The new minimum and maximum capacity. You can set both values or just one. At the scheduled time, if the current capacity is below the minimum capacity, Application Auto Scaling scales out to the minimum capacity. If the current capacity is above the maximum capacity, Application Auto Scaling scales in to the maximum capacity. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--scheduled_actions--scalable_target_action))
- `schedule` (String) The schedule for this action. The following formats are supported:
  +  At expressions - "``at(yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss)``"
  +  Rate expressions - "``rate(value unit)``"
  +  Cron expressions - "``cron(fields)``"
  
 At expressions are useful for one-time schedules. Cron expressions are useful for scheduled actions that run periodically at a specified date and time, and rate expressions are useful for scheduled actions that run at a regular interval.
 At and cron expressions use Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) by default.
 The cron format consists of six fields separated by white spaces: [Minutes] [Hours] [Day_of_Month] [Month] [Day_of_Week] [Year].
 For rate expressions, *value* is a positive integer and *unit* is ``minute`` | ``minutes`` | ``hour`` | ``hours`` | ``day`` | ``days``.
- `scheduled_action_name` (String) The name of the scheduled action. This name must be unique among all other scheduled actions on the specified scalable target.
- `start_time` (String) The date and time that the action is scheduled to begin, in UTC.
- `timezone` (String) The time zone used when referring to the date and time of a scheduled action, when the scheduled action uses an at or cron expression.

### Nested Schema for `scheduled_actions.scalable_target_action`

Optional:

- `max_capacity` (Number) The maximum capacity.
- `min_capacity` (Number) The minimum capacity.



<a id="nestedatt--suspended_state"></a>
### Nested Schema for `suspended_state`

Optional:

- `dynamic_scaling_in_suspended` (Boolean) Whether scale in by a target tracking scaling policy or a step scaling policy is suspended. Set the value to ``true`` if you don't want Application Auto Scaling to remove capacity when a scaling policy is triggered. The default is ``false``.
- `dynamic_scaling_out_suspended` (Boolean) Whether scale out by a target tracking scaling policy or a step scaling policy is suspended. Set the value to ``true`` if you don't want Application Auto Scaling to add capacity when a scaling policy is triggered. The default is ``false``.
- `scheduled_scaling_suspended` (Boolean) Whether scheduled scaling is suspended. Set the value to ``true`` if you don't want Application Auto Scaling to add or remove capacity by initiating scheduled actions. The default is ``false``.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_applicationautoscaling_scalable_target.example
  identity = {
    resource_id        = "resource_id"
    scalable_dimension = "scalable_dimension"
    service_namespace  = "service_namespace"
  }
}
```
