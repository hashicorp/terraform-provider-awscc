Resource Type definition for AWS::SageMaker::ImageVersion

## Example Usage

### SageMaker Image Version for PyTorch Training

Creates a SageMaker image version from a PyTorch GPU training container with associated IAM role and policy for ECR access, supporting multiple aliases and ML framework specifications.
