# awscc_cloudfront_public_key (Resource)

A public key that you can use with [signed URLs and signed cookies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html), or with [field-level encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/field-level-encryption.html).
 CloudFront supports signed URLs and signed cookies with RSA 2048 or ECDSA 256 key signatures. Field-level encryption is only compatible with RSA 2048 key signatures.

## Example Usage

The following example creates a CloudFront public key.

```terraform
resource "awscc_cloudfront_public_key" "example" {
  public_key_config = {
    caller_reference = "test-caller-reference"
    encoded_key      = file("public_key.pem")
    name             = "test_key"
    comment          = "test public key"
  }
}
```
