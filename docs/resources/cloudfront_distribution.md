## Schema

### Required

- `distribution_config` (Attributes) The distribution's configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--distribution_config))

### Optional

- `tags` (Attributes List) A complex type that contains zero or more ``Tag`` elements. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))

- `domain_name` (String)
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedatt--distribution_config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `distribution_config`

Required:

- `default_cache_behavior` (Attributes) A complex type that describes the default cache behavior if you don't specify a ``CacheBehavior`` element or if files don't match any of the values of ``PathPattern`` in ``CacheBehavior`` elements. You must create exactly one default cache behavior. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--distribution_config--default_cache_behavior))
- `enabled` (Boolean) From this field, you can enable or disable the selected distribution.

Optional:

- `aliases` (List of String) A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alternate domain names), if any, for this distribution.
- `cache_behaviors` (Attributes List) A complex type that contains zero or more ``CacheBehavior`` elements. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--distribution_config--cache_behaviors))
- `cnames` (List of String)
- `comment` (String) A comment to describe the distribution. The comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.
- `continuous_deployment_policy_id` (String) The identifier of a continuous deployment policy. For more information, see ``CreateContinuousDeploymentPolicy``.
- `custom_error_responses` (Attributes List) A complex type that controls the following:
  +  Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer.
  +  How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range.
  
 For more information about custom error pages, see [Customizing Error Responses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--distribution_config--custom_error_responses))
- `custom_origin` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--distribution_config--custom_origin))
- `default_root_object` (String) The object that you want CloudFront to request from your origin (for example, ``index.html``) when a viewer requests the root URL for your distribution (``https://www.example.com``) instead of an object in your distribution (``https://www.example.com/product-description.html``). Specifying a default root object avoids exposing the contents of your distribution.
 Specify only the object name, for example, ``index.html``. Don't add a ``/`` before the object name.
 If you don't want to specify a default root object when you create a distribution, include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.
 To delete the default root object from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element.
 To replace the default root object, update the distribution configuration and specify the new object.
 For more information about the default root object, see [Creating a Default Root Object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/D
- `http_version` (String) (Optional) Specify the maximum HTTP version(s) that you want viewers to use to communicate with CF. The default value for new distributions is ``http1.1``.
 For viewers and CF to use HTTP/2, viewers must support TLSv1.2 or later, and must support Server Name Indication (SNI).
 For viewers and CF to use HTTP/3, viewers must support TLSv1.3 and Server Name Indication (SNI). CF supports HTTP/3 connection migration to allow the viewer to switch networks without losing connection. For more information about connection migration, see [Connection Migration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#name-connection-migration) at RFC 9000. For more information about supported TLSv1.3 ciphers, see [Supported protocols and ciphers between viewers and CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html).
- `ipv6_enabled` (Boolean) If you want CloudFront to respond to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address for your distribution, specify ``true``. If you specify ``false``, CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the DNS response code ``NOERROR`` and with no IP addresses. This allows viewers to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your distribution.
 In general, you should enable IPv6 if you have users on IPv6 networks who want to access your content. However, if you're using signed URLs or signed cookies to restrict access to your content, and if you're using a custom policy that includes the ``IpAddress`` parameter to restrict the IP addresses that can access your content, don't enable IPv6. If you want to restrict access to some content by IP address and not restrict access to other content (or restrict access but not by IP address), you can create two distributions. For more information, see [Creating a Signed URL Using a Custom Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/Devel
- `logging` (Attributes) A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for the distribution.
 For more information about logging, see [Access Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--distribution_config--logging))
- `origin_groups` (Attributes) A complex type that contains information about origin groups for this distribution. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--distribution_config--origin_groups))
- `origins` (Attributes List) A complex type that contains information about origins for this distribution. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--distribution_config--origins))
- `price_class` (String) The price class that corresponds with the maximum price that you want to pay for CloudFront service. If you specify ``PriceClass_All``, CloudFront responds to requests for your objects from all CloudFront edge locations.
 If you specify a price class other than ``PriceClass_All``, CloudFront serves your objects from the CloudFront edge location that has the lowest latency among the edge locations in your price class. Viewers who are in or near regions that are excluded from your specified price class may encounter slower performance.
 For more information about price classes, see [Choosing the Price Class for a CloudFront Distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PriceClass.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*. For information about CloudFront pricing, including how price classes (such as Price Class 100) map to CloudFront regions, see [Amazon CloudFront Pricing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/).
- `restrictions` (Attributes) A complex type that identifies ways in which you want to restrict distribution of your content. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--distribution_config--restrictions))
- `s3_origin` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--distribution_config--s3_origin))
- `staging` (Boolean) A Boolean that indicates whether this is a staging distribution. When this value is ``true``, this is a staging distribution. When this value is ``false``, this is not a staging distribution.
- `viewer_certificate` (Attributes) A complex type that determines the distribution's SSL/TLS configuration for communicating with viewers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--distribution_config--viewer_certificate))
- `web_acl_id` (String) A unique identifier that specifies the WAF web ACL, if any, to associate with this distribution. To specify a web ACL created using the latest version of WAF, use the ACL ARN, for example ``arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleWebACL/473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a``. To specify a web ACL created using WAF Classic, use the ACL ID, for example ``473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a``.
  WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront, and lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked. For more information about WAF, see the [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest

Optional:

- `error_caching_min_ttl` (Number) The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want CloudFront to cache the HTTP status code specified in ``ErrorCode``. When this time period has elapsed, CloudFront queries your origin to see whether the problem that caused the error has been resolved and the requested object is now available.
 For more information, see [Customizing Error Responses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
- `response_code` (Number) The HTTP status code that you want CloudFront to return to the viewer along with the custom error page. There are a variety of reasons that you might want CloudFront to return a status code different from the status code that your origin returned to CloudFront, for example:
  +  Some Internet devices (some firewalls and corporate proxies, for example) intercept HTTP 4xx and 5xx and prevent the response from being returned to the viewer. If you substitute ``200``, the response typically won't be intercepted.
  +  If you don't care about distinguishing among different client errors or server errors, you can specify ``400`` or ``500`` as the ``ResponseCode`` for all 4xx or 5xx errors.
  +  You might want to return a ``200`` status code (OK) and static website so your customers don't know that your website is down.
  
 If you specify a value for ``ResponseCode``, you must also specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath``.
- `response_page_path` (String) The path to the custom error page that you want CloudFront to return to a viewer when your origin returns the HTTP status code specified by ``ErrorCode``, for example, ``/4xx-errors/403-forbidden.html``. If you want to store your objects and your custom error pages in different locations, your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the following is true:
  +  The value of ``PathPattern`` matches the path to your custom error messages. For example, suppose you saved custom error pages for 4xx errors in an Amazon S3 bucket in a directory named ``/4xx-errors``. Your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the path pattern routes requests for your custom error pages to that location, for example, ``/4xx-errors/*``.
  +  The value of ``TargetOriginId`` specifies the value of the ``ID`` element for the origin that contains your custom error pages.
  
 If you specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath``, you must also specify a value for ``ResponseCode``.

 To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``OriginAccessIdentity`` element.
 To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity.
 For more information about the origin access identity, see [Serving Private Content through CloudFront](https://d

### Nested Schema for `distribution_config.restrictions`

Required:

- `geo_restriction` (Attributes) A complex type that controls the countries in which your content is distributed. CF determines the location of your users using ``MaxMind`` GeoIP databases. To disable geo restriction, remove the [Restrictions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-cloudfront-distribution-distributionconfig.html#cfn-cloudfront-distribution-distributionconfig-restrictions) property from your stack template. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--distribution_config--restrictions--geo_restriction))

<a id="nestedatt--distribution_config--restrictions--geo_restriction"></a>
### Nested Schema for `distribution_config.restrictions.geo_restriction`

Required:

- `restriction_type` (String) The method that you want to use to restrict distribution of your content by country:
  +   ``none``: No geo restriction is enabled, meaning access to content is not restricted by client geo location.
  +   ``blacklist``: The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you don't want CloudFront to distribute your content.
  +   ``whitelist``: The ``Location`` elements specify the countries in which you want CloudFront to distribute your content.

Optional:

- `locations` (List of String) A complex type that contains a ``Location`` element for each country in which you want CloudFront either to distribute your content (``whitelist``) or not distribute your content (``blacklist``).
 The ``Location`` element is a two-letter, uppercase country code for a country that you want to include in your ``blacklist`` or ``whitelist``. Include one ``Location`` element for each country.
 CloudFront and ``MaxMind`` both use ``ISO 3166`` country codes. For the current list of countries and the corresponding codes, see ``ISO 3166-1-alpha-2`` code on the *International Organization for Standardization* website. You can also refer to the country list on the CloudFront console, which includes both country names and codes.



<a id="nestedatt--distribution_config--s3_origin"></a>
### Nested Schema for `distribution_config.s3_origin`

Required:

- `dns_name` (String)

Optional:

- `origin_access_identity` (String)


<a id="nestedatt--distribution_config--viewer_certificate"></a>
### Nested Schema for `distribution_config.viewer_certificate`

Optional:

- `acm_certificate_arn` (String) In CloudFormation, this field name is ``AcmCertificateArn``. Note the different capitalization.
  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in [(ACM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html), provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate. CloudFront only supports ACM certificates in the US East (N. Virginia) Region (``us-east-1``).
 If you specify an ACM certificate ARN, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod``. (In CloudFormation, the field name is ``SslSupportMethod``. Note the different capitalization.)
- `cloudfront_default_certificate` (Boolean) If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net``, set this field to ``true``.
 If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), omit this field and specify values for the following fields:
  +   ``AcmCertificateArn`` or ``IamCertificateId`` (specify a value for one, not both) 
  +   ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` 
  +   ``SslSupportMethod``
- `iam_certificate_id` (String) In CloudFormation, this field name is ``IamCertificateId``. Note the different capitalization.
  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in [(IAM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html), provide the ID of the IAM certificate.
 If you specify an IAM certificate ID, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod``. (In CloudFormation, the field name is ``SslSupportMethod``. Note the different capitalization.)
- `minimum_protocol_version` (String) If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify the security policy that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The security policy determines two settings:
  +  The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront can use to communicate with viewers.
  +  The ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the content that it returns to viewers.
  
 For more information, see [Security Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy) and [Supported Protocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
  On the CloudFront console, this setting is called *Security Policy*.
  When you're using SNI only (you set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-onl
- `ssl_support_method` (String) In CloudFormation, this field name is ``SslSupportMethod``. Note the different capitalization.
  If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from.
  +   ``sni-only`` ? The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from only viewers that support [server name indication (SNI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication). This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI.
  +   ``vip`` ? The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from all viewers including those that don't support SNI. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront.
  +   ``static-ip`` - Do not specify this value unless your distribution has been enabled for this feature by the CloudFront team. If you have a use case that requires static IP addresses for a distribution, contact CloudFront through the [Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/support/home).
