# awscc_eks_access_entry (Resource)

An object representing an Amazon EKS AccessEntry.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "awscc_eks_access_entry" "example" {
  cluster_name  = var.cluster_name
  principal_arn = var.role_arn
  type          = "STANDARD"
  access_policies = [
    {
      access_scope = {
        type       = "namespace"
        namespaces = ["default"]
      }
      policy_arn = "arn:aws:eks::aws:cluster-access-policy/AmazonEKSAdminPolicy"
    },
    {
      access_scope = {
        type = "cluster"
      },
      policy_arn = "arn:aws:eks::aws:cluster-access-policy/AmazonEKSEditPolicy"
    }
  ]

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

variable "cluster_name" {
  type = string
}

variable "role_arn" {
  type = string
}

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_eks_access_entry.example
  identity = {
    principal_arn = "principal_arn"
    cluster_name  = "cluster_name"
  }
}
```

### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `cluster_name` (String) The cluster that the access entry is created for
- `principal_arn` (String) The principal ARN that the access entry is created for

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed
- `region` (String) Region where this resource is managed

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_eks_access_entry.example
  id = "principal_arn|cluster_name"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_eks_access_entry.example "principal_arn|cluster_name"
```
