```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_refactorspaces_environment.example
  id = "environment_identifier"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_refactorspaces_environment.example "environment_identifier"
```
