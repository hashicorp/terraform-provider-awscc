# awscc_ecr_replication_configuration (Resource)

The ``AWS::ECR::ReplicationConfiguration`` resource creates or updates the replication configuration for a private registry. The first time a replication configuration is applied to a private registry, a service-linked IAM role is created in your account for the replication process. For more information, see [Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide*.
  When configuring cross-account replication, the destination account must grant the source account permission to replicate. This permission is controlled using a private registry permissions policy. For more information, see ``AWS::ECR::RegistryPolicy``.

## Example Usage

### Cross-Region ECR Repository Replication

Configure ECR repository replication across multiple AWS regions for repositories with 'prod-' prefix, enabling image replication to two destination regions for enhanced availability and disaster recovery.

```terraform
# Get current AWS account and region
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}
# Note: Using data.aws_region.current.region (AWS provider v6.0+)
# For AWS provider < v6.0, use data.aws_region.current.name instead
data "aws_region" "current" {}

# Create cross region replication configuration
resource "awscc_ecr_replication_configuration" "example" {
  replication_configuration = {
    rules = [
      {
        destinations = [
          {
            region      = (data.aws_region.current.region == "eu-west-1" ? "us-west-2" : "eu-west-1") # Primary replication region
            registry_id = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id
          },
          {
            region      = "ap-southeast-1" # Secondary replication region
            registry_id = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id
          }
        ]
        repository_filters = [
          {
            filter      = "prod-"
            filter_type = "PREFIX_MATCH"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

## Schema

### Required

- `replication_configuration` (Attributes) The replication configuration for a registry. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--replication_configuration))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `registry_id` (String)

<a id="nestedatt--replication_configuration"></a>
### Nested Schema for `replication_configuration`

Required:

- `rules` (Attributes List) An array of objects representing the replication destinations and repository filters for a replication configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--replication_configuration--rules))

<a id="nestedatt--replication_configuration--rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `replication_configuration.rules`

Required:

- `destinations` (Attributes List) An array of objects representing the destination for a replication rule. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--replication_configuration--rules--destinations))

Optional:

- `repository_filters` (Attributes List) An array of objects representing the filters for a replication rule. Specifying a repository filter for a replication rule provides a method for controlling which repositories in a private registry are replicated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--replication_configuration--rules--repository_filters))

<a id="nestedatt--replication_configuration--rules--destinations"></a>
### Nested Schema for `replication_configuration.rules.destinations`

Required:

- `region` (String) The Region to replicate to.
- `registry_id` (String) The AWS account ID of the Amazon ECR private registry to replicate to. When configuring cross-Region replication within your own registry, specify your own account ID.


<a id="nestedatt--replication_configuration--rules--repository_filters"></a>
### Nested Schema for `replication_configuration.rules.repository_filters`

Optional:

- `filter` (String) The repository filter details. When the ``PREFIX_MATCH`` filter type is specified, this value is required and should be the repository name prefix to configure replication for.
- `filter_type` (String) The repository filter type. The only supported value is ``PREFIX_MATCH``, which is a repository name prefix specified with the ``filter`` parameter.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_ecr_replication_configuration.example "registry_id"
```
