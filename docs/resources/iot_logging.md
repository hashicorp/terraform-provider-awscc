# awscc_iot_logging (Resource)

Logging Options enable you to configure your IoT V2 logging role and default logging level so that you can monitor progress events logs as it passes from your devices through Iot core service.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "awscc_iot_logging" "example" {
  account_id        = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id
  default_log_level = "INFO"
  role_arn          = awscc_iam_role.example.arn
}

resource "awscc_iam_role" "example" {
  role_name   = "example"
  description = "Role that allows IoT to write to Cloudwatch logs"
  assume_role_policy_document = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
        Effect = "Allow"
        Principal = {
          Service = "iot.amazonaws.com"
        }
      }
    ]
  })
  tags = [
    {
      key   = "Modified By"
      value = "AWSCC"
    }
  ]
}

resource "awscc_iam_role_policy" "example" {
  policy_name = "example"
  role_name   = awscc_iam_role.example.role_name
  policy_document = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect = "Allow"
        Action = [
          "logs:CreateLogGroup",
          "logs:CreateLogStream",
          "logs:PutLogEvents",
          "logs:PutMetricFilter",
          "logs:PutRetentionPolicy",
          "iot:GetLoggingOptions",
          "iot:SetLoggingOptions",
          "iot:SetV2LoggingOptions",
          "iot:GetV2LoggingOptions",
          "iot:SetV2LoggingLevel",
          "iot:ListV2LoggingLevels",
          "iot:DeleteV2LoggingLevel"
        ]
        Resource = [
          "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:log-group:AWSIotLogsV2:*"
        ]
      }
    ]
  })
}

data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `account_id` (String) Your 12-digit account ID (used as the primary identifier for the CloudFormation resource).
- `default_log_level` (String) The log level to use. Valid values are: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, or DISABLED.
- `role_arn` (String) The ARN of the role that allows IoT to write to Cloudwatch logs.

### Optional

- `event_configurations` (Attributes List) Configurations for event-based logging that specifies which event types to log and their logging settings. Overrides account-level logging for the specified event (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--event_configurations))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

<a id="nestedatt--event_configurations"></a>
### Nested Schema for `event_configurations`

Optional:

- `event_type` (String) The type of event to log. These include event types like Connect, Publish, and Disconnect.
- `log_destination` (String) CloudWatch Log Group for event-based logging. Specifies where log events should be sent. The log destination for event-based logging overrides default Log Group for the specified event type and applies to all resources associated with that event.
- `log_level` (String) The logging level for the specified event type. Determines the verbosity of log messages generated for this event type.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_iot_logging.example
  identity = {
    account_id = "account_id"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema


#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed
- `region` (String) Region where this resource is managed

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_iot_logging.example
  id = "account_id"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_iot_logging.example "account_id"
```
