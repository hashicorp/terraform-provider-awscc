  name        = "example-worker-config"
  description = "Example worker configuration for MSK Connect"

  # Base64 encoded content of connect-distributed.properties
  properties_file_content = base64encode(<<-EOT
    key.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter
    value.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter
    EOT
  )

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_kafkaconnect_worker_configuration.example
  id = "worker_configuration_arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_kafkaconnect_worker_configuration.example "worker_configuration_arn"
```
