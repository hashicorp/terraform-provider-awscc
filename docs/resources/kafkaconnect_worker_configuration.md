  description = "Example worker configuration for MSK Connect"

  # Base64 encoded content of connect-distributed.properties
  properties_file_content = base64encode(<<-EOT
    key.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter
    value.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter
    EOT
