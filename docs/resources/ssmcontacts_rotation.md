```terraform
# Get current AWS account ID and region
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}
data "aws_region" "current" {}

# Example SSM Contact Rotation
resource "awscc_ssmcontacts_rotation" "example" {
  name         = "weekly_oncall_rotation"
  contact_ids  = ["arn:aws:ssm-contacts:${data.aws_region.current.name}:${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:contact/example-contact"]
  time_zone_id = "America/Los_Angeles"
  start_time   = "2025-01-05T09:00:00"

  recurrence = {
    weekly_settings = [{

      hand_off_time = "09:00"
    }]
    number_of_on_calls    = 1
    recurrence_multiplier = 1
  }

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ssmcontacts_rotation.example
  identity = {
    arn = "arn"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rotation

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed
- `region` (String) Region where this resource is managed

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ssmcontacts_rotation.example
  id = "arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_ssmcontacts_rotation.example "arn"
```
