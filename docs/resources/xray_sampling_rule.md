# awscc_xray_sampling_rule (Resource)

This schema provides construct and validation rules for AWS-XRay SamplingRule resource parameters.

## Example Usage
 
```terraform
resource "awscc_xray_sampling_rule" "example" {
  # The root rule_name is not required and is provided for backwards compatibility on schema. rule_name/rule_arn inside sampling_rule is required.
  sampling_rule = {
    rule_name      = "example"
    fixed_rate     = 0.05
    host           = "MyHost"
    http_method    = "GET"
    priority       = 9999
    reservoir_size = 1
    resource_arn   = "*"
    service_name   = "MyServiceName"
    service_type   = "MyServiceType"
    url_path       = "*"
    version        = 1
  }

  tags = [
    {
      key   = "ModifiedBy"
      value = "AWSCC"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `rule_name` (String) The ARN of the sampling rule. Specify a rule by either name or ARN, but not both.
- `sampling_rule` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sampling_rule))
- `sampling_rule_record` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sampling_rule_record))
- `sampling_rule_update` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sampling_rule_update))
- `tags` (Attributes List) An array of key-value pairs to apply to this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `rule_arn` (String) The ARN of the sampling rule. Specify a rule by either name or ARN, but not both.

<a id="nestedatt--sampling_rule"></a>
### Nested Schema for `sampling_rule`

Optional:

- `attributes` (Map of String) Matches attributes derived from the request.

- `resource_arn` (String) Matches the ARN of the AWS resource on which the service runs.
- `rule_arn` (String) The ARN of the sampling rule. Specify a rule by either name or ARN, but not both.
- `rule_name` (String) The ARN of the sampling rule. Specify a rule by either name or ARN, but not both.
- `service_name` (String) Matches the name that the service uses to identify itself in segments.
- `service_type` (String) Matches the origin that the service uses to identify its type in segments.
- `url_path` (String) Matches the path from a request URL.
- `version` (Number) The version of the sampling rule format (1)

### Nested Schema for `sampling_rule_record`

Optional:

- `created_at` (String) When the rule was created, in Unix time seconds.
- `modified_at` (String) When the rule was modified, in Unix time seconds.
- `sampling_rule` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sampling_rule_record--sampling_rule))

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_xray_sampling_rule.example
  identity = {
    rule_arn = "rule_arn"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `rule_arn` (String) The ARN of the sampling rule

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The ID of the AWS account
- `region` (String) The AWS region where the resource is located

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_xray_sampling_rule.example
  id = "rule_arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_xray_sampling_rule.example "rule_arn"
```
