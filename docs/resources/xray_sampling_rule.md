# awscc_xray_sampling_rule (Resource)

This schema provides construct and validation rules for AWS-XRay SamplingRule resource parameters.

## Example Usage
 
```terraform
resource "awscc_xray_sampling_rule" "example" {
  # The root rule_name is not required and is provided for backwards compatibility on schema. rule_name/rule_arn inside sampling_rule is required.
  sampling_rule = {
    rule_name      = "example"
    fixed_rate     = 0.05
    host           = "MyHost"
    http_method    = "GET"
    priority       = 9999
    reservoir_size = 1
    resource_arn   = "*"
    service_name   = "MyServiceName"
    service_type   = "MyServiceType"
    url_path       = "*"
    version        = 1
  }

  tags = [
    {
      key   = "ModifiedBy"
      value = "AWSCC"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `rule_name` (String) The ARN of the sampling rule. Specify a rule by either name or ARN, but not both.
- `sampling_rule` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sampling_rule))
- `sampling_rule_record` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sampling_rule_record))
- `sampling_rule_update` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sampling_rule_update))
- `tags` (Attributes List) An array of key-value pairs to apply to this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `rule_arn` (String) The ARN of the sampling rule. Specify a rule by either name or ARN, but not both.

<a id="nestedatt--sampling_rule"></a>
### Nested Schema for `sampling_rule`

Optional:

- `attributes` (Map of String) Matches attributes derived from the request.
- `fixed_rate` (Number) The percentage of matching requests to instrument, after the reservoir is exhausted.
- `host` (String) Matches the hostname from a request URL.
- `http_method` (String) Matches the HTTP method from a request URL.
- `priority` (Number) The priority of the sampling rule.
- `reservoir_size` (Number) A fixed number of matching requests to instrument per second, prior to applying the fixed rate. The reservoir is not used directly by services, but applies to all services using the rule collectively.
- `resource_arn` (String) Matches the ARN of the AWS resource on which the service runs.
- `rule_arn` (String) The ARN of the sampling rule. Specify a rule by either name or ARN, but not both.
- `rule_name` (String) The ARN of the sampling rule. Specify a rule by either name or ARN, but not both.
- `service_name` (String) Matches the name that the service uses to identify itself in segments.
- `service_type` (String) Matches the origin that the service uses to identify its type in segments.
- `url_path` (String) Matches the path from a request URL.
- `version` (Number) The version of the sampling rule format (1)

### Nested Schema for `sampling_rule_record`

Optional:

- `created_at` (String) When the rule was created, in Unix time seconds.
- `modified_at` (String) When the rule was modified, in Unix time seconds.
- `sampling_rule` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sampling_rule_record--sampling_rule))

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_xray_sampling_rule.example
  id = "rule_arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_xray_sampling_rule.example "rule_arn"
```
