## Schema

### Required

- `content` (String) The policy document. For AWS CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. AWS CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it.

### Read-Only

- `arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource policy.
- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `resource_policy_id` (String) The unique identifier (ID) associated with this resource policy.

<a id="nestedatt--tags"></a>
### Nested Schema for `tags`

Optional:

- `key` (String) The key identifier, or name, of the tag.
- `value` (String) The string value that's associated with the key of the tag. You can set the value of a tag to an empty string, but you can't set the value of a tag to null.

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:
