```terraform
# Create a cluster first as it's required for the control panel
resource "awscc_route53recoverycontrol_cluster" "example" {
  name = "example-cluster"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

# Create the control panel
resource "awscc_route53recoverycontrol_control_panel" "example" {
  name        = "example-control-panel"
  cluster_arn = awscc_route53recoverycontrol_cluster.example.cluster_arn

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_route53recoverycontrol_control_panel.example
  identity = {
    control_panel_arn = "control_panel_arn"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `control_panel_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The ID of the AWS account

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_route53recoverycontrol_control_panel.example
  id = "control_panel_arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_route53recoverycontrol_control_panel.example "control_panel_arn"
```
