# awscc_ec2_enclave_certificate_iam_role_association (Resource)

Associates an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with an AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate. This association is based on Amazon Resource Names and it enables the certificate to be used by the ACM for Nitro Enclaves application inside an enclave.

## Example Usage

### EC2 Enclave Certificate Role Association

This example demonstrates how to associate an IAM role with an ACM certificate for EC2 Nitro Enclaves, including the creation of necessary IAM roles with permissions to access ACM certificate operations.

~> This example is generated by LLM using Amazon Bedrock and validated using terraform validate, apply and destroy. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date. We recommend independently verifying the content.

```terraform
# Create an IAM role that can be associated with the ACM certificate
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "ec2_nitro_enclaves_assume_role" {
  statement {
    actions = ["sts:AssumeRole"]

    principals {
      type        = "Service"
      identifiers = ["ec2.amazonaws.com"]
    }
  }
}

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "acm_access" {
  statement {
    actions = [
      "acm:GetCertificateRequest",
      "acm:ExportCertificate",
    ]

    resources = ["*"]

    effect = "Allow"
  }
}

resource "awscc_iam_role" "nitro_enclave_role" {
  role_name = "nitro-enclave-role"
  assume_role_policy_document = jsonencode(
    jsondecode(data.aws_iam_policy_document.ec2_nitro_enclaves_assume_role.json)
  )

  tags = [{
    key   = "Created By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

resource "awscc_iam_role_policy" "nitro_enclave_policy" {
  role_name   = awscc_iam_role.nitro_enclave_role.role_name
  policy_name = "nitro-enclave-acm-access"
  policy_document = jsonencode(
    jsondecode(data.aws_iam_policy_document.acm_access.json)
  )
}

# Create a self-signed certificate for testing
resource "aws_acm_certificate" "cert" {
  domain_name       = "example.com"
  validation_method = "EMAIL"

  tags = {
    "Created By" = "AWSCC"
  }

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

# Associate the IAM role with the ACM certificate
resource "awscc_ec2_enclave_certificate_iam_role_association" "example" {
  certificate_arn = aws_acm_certificate.cert.arn
  role_arn        = awscc_iam_role.nitro_enclave_role.arn
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `certificate_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate with which to associate the IAM role.
- `role_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to associate with the ACM certificate. You can associate up to 16 IAM roles with an ACM certificate.

### Read-Only

- `certificate_s3_bucket_name` (String) The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to which the certificate was uploaded.
- `certificate_s3_object_key` (String) The Amazon S3 object key where the certificate, certificate chain, and encrypted private key bundle are stored.
- `encryption_kms_key_id` (String) The ID of the AWS KMS CMK used to encrypt the private key of the certificate.
- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_enclave_certificate_iam_role_association.example
  identity = {
    certificate_arn = "certificate_arn"
    role_arn        = "role_arn"
  }
}
```

### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `certificate_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate with which to associate the IAM role
- `role_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to associate with the ACM certificate

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The ID of the AWS account
- `region` (String) The AWS region where the resource is located

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_enclave_certificate_iam_role_association.example
  id = "certificate_arn|role_arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_ec2_enclave_certificate_iam_role_association.example "certificate_arn|role_arn"
```
