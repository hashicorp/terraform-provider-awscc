## Schema

### Required

- `actions` (Attributes Set) The actions.
 The rule must include exactly one of the following types of actions: ``forward``, ``fixed-response``, or ``redirect``, and it must be the last action to be performed. If the rule is for an HTTPS listener, it can also optionally include an authentication action. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--actions))
- `conditions` (Attributes Set) The conditions.
 The rule can optionally include up to one of each of the following conditions: ``http-request-method``, ``host-header``, ``path-pattern``, and ``source-ip``. A rule can also optionally include one or more of each of the following conditions: ``http-header`` and ``query-string``. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--conditions))
- `priority` (Number) The rule priority. A listener can't have multiple rules with the same priority.
 If you try to reorder rules by updating their priorities, do not specify a new priority if an existing rule already uses this priority, as this can cause an error. If you need to reuse a priority with a different rule, you must remove it as a priority first, and then specify it in a subsequent update.

### Optional

- `listener_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `is_default` (Boolean)
- `rule_arn` (String)

Specify only when ``Type`` is ``forward``. If you specify both ``ForwardConfig`` and ``TargetGroupArn``, you can specify only one target group using ``ForwardConfig`` and it must be the same target group specified in ``TargetGroupArn``. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--actions--forward_config))
- `order` (Number) The order for the action. This value is required for rules with multiple actions. The action with the lowest value for order is performed first.

- `target_group_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target group. Specify only when ``Type`` is ``forward`` and you want to route to a single target group. To route to one or more target groups, use ``ForwardConfig`` instead.

<a id="nestedatt--conditions--host_header_config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `conditions.host_header_config`

Optional:

- `values` (Set of String) The host names. The maximum size of each name is 128 characters. The comparison is case insensitive. The following wildcard characters are supported: * (matches 0 or more characters) and ? (matches exactly 1 character). You must include at least one "." character. You can include only alphabetical characters after the final "." character.
 If you specify multiple strings, the condition is satisfied if one of the strings matches the host name.


<a id="nestedatt--conditions--http_header_config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `conditions.http_header_config`

Optional:

- `http_header_name` (String) The name of the HTTP header field. The maximum size is 40 characters. The header name is case insensitive. The allowed characters are specified by RFC 7230. Wildcards are not supported.
- `values` (Set of String) The strings to compare against the value of the HTTP header. The maximum size of each string is 128 characters. The comparison strings are case insensitive. The following wildcard characters are supported: * (matches 0 or more characters) and ? (matches exactly 1 character).
 If the same header appears multiple times in the request, we search them in order until a match is found.
 If you specify multiple strings, the condition is satisfied if one of the strings matches the value of the HTTP header. To require that all of the strings are a match, create one condition per string.


<a id="nestedatt--conditions--http_request_method_config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `conditions.http_request_method_config`

Optional:

- `values` (Set of String) The name of the request method. The maximum size is 40 characters. The allowed characters are A-Z, hyphen (-), and underscore (_). The comparison is case sensitive. Wildcards are not supported; therefore, the method name must be an exact match.
 If you specify multiple strings, the condition is satisfied if one of the strings matches the HTTP request method. We recommend that you route GET and HEAD requests in the same way, because the response to a HEAD request may be cached.


<a id="nestedatt--conditions--path_pattern_config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `conditions.path_pattern_config`

Optional:

- `values` (Set of String) The path patterns to compare against the request URL. The maximum size of each string is 128 characters. The comparison is case sensitive. The following wildcard characters are supported: * (matches 0 or more characters) and ? (matches exactly 1 character).
 If you specify multiple strings, the condition is satisfied if one of them matches the request URL. The path pattern is compared only to the path of the URL, not to its query string.


<a id="nestedatt--conditions--query_string_config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `conditions.query_string_config`

Optional:

- `values` (Attributes Set) The key/value pairs or values to find in the query string. The maximum size of each string is 128 characters. The comparison is case insensitive. The following wildcard characters are supported: * (matches 0 or more characters) and ? (matches exactly 1 character). To search for a literal '*' or '?' character in a query string, you must escape these characters in ``Values`` using a '\' character.
 If you specify multiple key/value pairs or values, the condition is satisfied if one of them is found in the query string. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--conditions--query_string_config--values))

<a id="nestedatt--conditions--query_string_config--values"></a>
### Nested Schema for `conditions.query_string_config.values`

Optional:

- `key` (String) The key. You can omit the key.
- `value` (String) The value.



<a id="nestedatt--conditions--source_ip_config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `conditions.source_ip_config`

Optional:

- `values` (Set of String) The source IP addresses, in CIDR format. You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Wildcards are not supported.
 If you specify multiple addresses, the condition is satisfied if the source IP address of the request matches one of the CIDR blocks. This condition is not satisfied by the addresses in the X-Forwarded-For header.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_elasticloadbalancingv2_listener_rule.example
  id = "rule_arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_elasticloadbalancingv2_listener_rule.example "rule_arn"
```
