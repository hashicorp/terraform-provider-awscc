data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}
# Note: Using data.aws_region.current.region (AWS provider v6.0+)
# For AWS provider < v6.0, use data.aws_region.current.name instead
data "aws_region" "current" {}

resource "awscc_backup_report_plan" "example" {
  report_plan_name        = "backup_report_example"
  report_plan_description = "Example backup report plan using AWSCC provider"

  report_delivery_channel = {
    s3_bucket_name = "${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}-backup-reports-${data.aws_region.current.region}"
    formats        = ["CSV", "JSON"]
    s3_key_prefix  = "backup-reports"
  }

    regions         = [data.aws_region.current.region]
