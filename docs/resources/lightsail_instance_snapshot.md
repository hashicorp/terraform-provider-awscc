### Create Lightsail Instance Snapshot

Creates a snapshot of an Amazon Lightsail instance, demonstrating the configuration of both the source Lightsail instance and its snapshot using the AWSCC provider.

~> This example is generated by LLM using Amazon Bedrock and validated using terraform validate, apply and destroy. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date. We recommend independently verifying the content.

```terraform
# Get current AWS region
data "aws_region" "current" {}

# Create a Lightsail instance first to take a snapshot from
resource "awscc_lightsail_instance" "example" {
  instance_name     = "example-instance"
  availability_zone = "${data.aws_region.current.name}a"
  blueprint_id      = "amazon_linux_2"
  bundle_id         = "nano_2_0"

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

# Create the instance snapshot
resource "awscc_lightsail_instance_snapshot" "example" {
  instance_name          = awscc_lightsail_instance.example.instance_name
  instance_snapshot_name = "example-snapshot"

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```
