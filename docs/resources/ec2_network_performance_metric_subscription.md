```terraform
resource "awscc_ec2_network_performance_metric_subscription" "example" {
  source      = "us-east-1" # Source region
  destination = "us-west-2" # Destination region (must be different from source)
  metric      = "aggregate-latency"
  statistic   = "p50"
}
```

### Required

- `destination` (String) The target Region or Availability Zone for the metric to subscribe to.
- `metric` (String) The metric type to subscribe to.
- `source` (String) The starting Region or Availability Zone for metric to subscribe to.

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_network_performance_metric_subscription.example
  identity = {
    source      = "source"
    destination = "destination"
    metric      = "metric"
    statistic   = "statistic"
  }
}
```
