# awscc_cloudtrail_channel (Resource)

A channel receives events from a specific source (such as an on-premises storage solution or application, or a partner event data source), and delivers the events to one or more event data stores. You use channels to ingest events into CloudTrail from sources outside AWS.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "awscc_cloudtrail_channel" "example" {
  name   = "example"
  source = "Custom"
  destinations = [{
    type     = "EVENT_DATA_STORE"
    location = awscc_cloudtrail_event_data_store.example.event_data_store_arn
  }]
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}


resource "awscc_cloudtrail_event_data_store" "example" {
  name                           = "example"
  retention_period               = 90
  federation_enabled             = false
  termination_protection_enabled = false
  multi_region_enabled           = false
  ingestion_enabled              = true
  billing_mode                   = "EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING"
  organization_enabled           = false
  advanced_event_selectors = [{
    field_selectors = [{
      field  = "eventCategory"
      equals = ["ActivityAuditLog"]
    }]
  }]

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_cloudtrail_channel.example
  identity = {
    channel_arn = "channel_arn"
  }
}
```

### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `channel_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a channel

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed
- `region` (String) Region where this resource is managed

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_cloudtrail_channel.example
  id = "channel_arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_cloudtrail_channel.example "channel_arn"
```
