```terraform
# Get current account information
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

# First create a cell that we'll reference in the recovery group
resource "awscc_route53recoveryreadiness_cell" "example" {
  cell_name = "example-cell-${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

# Create the recovery group
resource "awscc_route53recoveryreadiness_recovery_group" "example" {
  recovery_group_name = "example-recovery-group-${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}"
  cells               = [awscc_route53recoveryreadiness_cell.example.cell_arn]
  tags = [{

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_route53recoveryreadiness_recovery_group.example
  id = "recovery_group_name"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_route53recoveryreadiness_recovery_group.example "recovery_group_name"
```
