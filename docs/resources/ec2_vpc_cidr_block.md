# awscc_ec2_vpc_cidr_block (Resource)

Resource Type definition for AWS::EC2::VPCCidrBlock

## Example Usage

### Add Secondary CIDR Block to VPC

Creates an additional CIDR block (10.1.0.0/16) to an existing VPC, enabling the expansion of the IP address range for the VPC infrastructure.

```terraform
# Create a VPC first
resource "awscc_ec2_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

# Add secondary CIDR block to the VPC
resource "awscc_ec2_vpc_cidr_block" "secondary_cidr" {
  vpc_id     = awscc_ec2_vpc.example.id
  cidr_block = "10.1.0.0/16"
}
```

- `ipv_6_pool` (String) The ID of an IPv6 address pool from which to allocate the IPv6 CIDR block.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `ip_source` (String) The IP Source of an IPv6 VPC CIDR Block.
- `ipv_6_address_attribute` (String) The value denoting whether an IPv6 VPC CIDR Block is public or private.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_vpc_cidr_block.example
  identity = {
    id     = "id"
    vpc_id = "vpc_id"
  }
}
```

### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `id` (String) The Id of the VPC associated CIDR Block
- `vpc_id` (String) The ID of the VPC

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed
- `region` (String) Region where this resource is managed

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_vpc_cidr_block.example
  id = "id|vpc_id"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_ec2_vpc_cidr_block.example "id|vpc_id"
```
