# awscc_ce_anomaly_monitor (Resource)

AWS Cost Anomaly Detection leverages advanced Machine Learning technologies to identify anomalous spend and root causes, so you can quickly take action. You can use Cost Anomaly Detection by creating monitor.

## Example Usage

### AWS Cost Anomaly Monitor by Service

Creates a dimensional cost anomaly monitor that tracks AWS cost anomalies at the service level, helping to identify unusual spending patterns across AWS services.

```terraform
# Create cost anomaly monitor for AWS cost
resource "awscc_ce_anomaly_monitor" "cost_monitor" {
  monitor_name = "aws-cost-monitor"
  monitor_type = "DIMENSIONAL"
  monitor_specification = jsonencode({
    dimensions = {
      key = "SERVICE"
    }
  })

  resource_tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```

- `monitor_type` (String)

### Optional

- `monitor_dimension` (String) The dimensions to evaluate
- `monitor_specification` (String)
- `resource_tags` (Attributes List) Tags to assign to monitor. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--resource_tags))

### Read-Only

- `creation_date` (String) The date when the monitor was created.
- `dimensional_value_count` (Number) The value for evaluated dimensions.
- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Nested Schema for `resource_tags`

Optional:

- `key` (String) The key name for the tag.
- `value` (String) The value for the tag.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ce_anomaly_monitor.example
  id = "monitor_arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_ce_anomaly_monitor.example "monitor_arn"
```
