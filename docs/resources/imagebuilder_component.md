  name     = "install-httpd-component"
  platform = "Linux"
  version  = "1.0.0"

  description = "Component to install and configure Apache HTTP Server"
  data = yamlencode({
    schemaVersion = "1.0"
    phases = [{
      name = "build"
      steps = [{
        name   = "InstallHttpd"
        action = "ExecuteBash"
        inputs = {
          commands = [
