# awscc_efs_mount_target (Resource)

The ``AWS::EFS::MountTarget`` resource is an Amazon EFS resource that creates a mount target for an EFS file system. You can then mount the file system on Amazon EC2 instances or other resources by using the mount target.

## Example Usage

### EFS Mount Target
To use `awscc_efs_mount_target` with `awscc_efs_file_system`:
```terraform
resource "awscc_efs_mount_target" "main" {
  file_system_id  = awscc_efs_file_system.main.id
  subnet_id       = awscc_ec2_subnet.main.id
  security_groups = ["sg-xxxxxx"]
}

resource "awscc_efs_file_system" "main" {

  file_system_tags = [
    {
      key   = "Name"
      value = "this"
    },
    {
      key   = "Modified By"
      value = "AWSCC"
    }
  ]
}

resource "awscc_ec2_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "awscc_ec2_subnet" "main" {
  vpc_id     = resource.awscc_ec2_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `file_system_id` (String) The ID of the file system for which to create the mount target.
- `security_groups` (Set of String) VPC security group IDs, of the form ``sg-xxxxxxxx``. These must be for the same VPC as the subnet specified. The maximum number of security groups depends on account quota. For more information, see [Amazon VPC Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide* (see the *Security Groups* table).
- `subnet_id` (String) The ID of the subnet to add the mount target in. For One Zone file systems, use the subnet that is associated with the file system's Availability Zone.

### Optional

- `ip_address` (String) Valid IPv4 address within the address range of the specified subnet.
- `ip_address_type` (String)
- `ipv_6_address` (String)

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `mount_target_id` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_efs_mount_target.example
  id = "id"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_efs_mount_target.example "id"
```
