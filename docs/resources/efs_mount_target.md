# awscc_efs_mount_target (Resource)

The ``AWS::EFS::MountTarget`` resource is an Amazon EFS resource that creates a mount target for an EFS file system. You can then mount the file system on Amazon EC2 instances or other resources by using the mount target.

## Example Usage

### EFS Mount Target
To use `awscc_efs_mount_target` with `awscc_efs_file_system`:
```terraform
resource "awscc_efs_mount_target" "main" {
  file_system_id = awscc_efs_file_system.main.id
  subnet_id      = awscc_ec2_subnet.main.id
  security_groups = ["sg-xxxxxx"]
}

resource "awscc_efs_file_system" "main" {

  file_system_tags = [
    {
      key   = "Name"
      value = "this"
    },
    {
      key   = "Modified By"
      value = "AWSCC"
    }
  ]
}

resource "awscc_ec2_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "awscc_ec2_subnet" "main" {
  vpc_id     = resource.awscc_ec2_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```
