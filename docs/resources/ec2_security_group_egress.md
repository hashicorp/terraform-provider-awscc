  Adds the specified outbound (egress) rule to a security group.
  An outbound rule permits instances to send traffic to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address range, the IP addresses that are specified by a prefix list, or the instances that are associated with a destination security group. For more information, see Security group rules https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-group-rules.html.
  You must specify exactly one of the following destinations: an IPv4 address range, an IPv6 address range, a prefix list, or a security group.
  You must specify a protocol for each rule (for example, TCP). If the protocol is TCP or UDP, you must also specify a port or port range. If the protocol is ICMP or ICMPv6, you must also specify the ICMP/ICMPv6 type and code. To specify all types or all codes, use -1.
  Rule changes are propagated to instances associated with the security group as quickly as possible. However, a small delay might occur.

# awscc_ec2_security_group_egress (Resource)

Adds the specified outbound (egress) rule to a security group.
 An outbound rule permits instances to send traffic to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address range, the IP addresses that are specified by a prefix list, or the instances that are associated with a destination security group. For more information, see [Security group rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-group-rules.html).
 You must specify exactly one of the following destinations: an IPv4 address range, an IPv6 address range, a prefix list, or a security group.
 You must specify a protocol for each rule (for example, TCP). If the protocol is TCP or UDP, you must also specify a port or port range. If the protocol is ICMP or ICMPv6, you must also specify the ICMP/ICMPv6 type and code. To specify all types or all codes, use -1.
 Rule changes are propagated to instances associated with the security group as quickly as possible. However, a small delay might occur.

## Example Usage

### Egress allow all

Usage example for the egress rule resource for both IPv4 and IPv6.

```terraform
resource "awscc_ec2_security_group_egress" "allow_all_traffic_ipv4" {
  group_id    = awscc_ec2_security_group.allow_all.id
  cidr_ip     = "0.0.0.0/0"
  ip_protocol = "-1" # semantically equivalent to all ports
  description = "Outbound rule to allow all traffic"
}

resource "awscc_ec2_security_group_egress" "allow_all_traffic_ipv6" {
  group_id    = awscc_ec2_security_group.allow_all.id
  cidr_ipv_6  = "::/0"
  ip_protocol = "-1" # semantically equivalent to all ports
  description = "Outbound rule to allow all traffic"

}

resource "awscc_ec2_security_group" "allow_all" {
  group_description = "Allow all outbound traffic"
  vpc_id            = awscc_ec2_vpc.selected.id

  tags = [
    {
      key   = "Name"
      value = "allow_all"
    }
  ]
}

resource "awscc_ec2_vpc_cidr_block" "selected" {
  amazon_provided_ipv_6_cidr_block = true
  vpc_id                           = awscc_ec2_vpc.selected.id
}

resource "awscc_ec2_vpc" "selected" {
  cidr_block           = "10.0.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
}
```

### Egress allow by port

Usage example for the egress rule resource with ports specified.

```terraform
resource "awscc_ec2_security_group_egress" "allow_https_traffic_ipv4" {
  group_id    = awscc_ec2_security_group.example.id
  cidr_ip     = "0.0.0.0/0"
  ip_protocol = "tcp"
  from_port   = 443
  to_port     = 443
  description = "Outbound rule to allow https traffic"
}

resource "awscc_ec2_security_group" "example" {
  group_description = "Example SG"
  vpc_id            = awscc_ec2_vpc.selected.id

  tags = [
    {
      key   = "Name"
      value = "example_sg"
    }
  ]
}

resource "awscc_ec2_vpc" "selected" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `group_id` (String) The ID of the security group. You must specify either the security group ID or the security group name in the request. For security groups in a nondefault VPC, you must specify the security group ID.
- `ip_protocol` (String) The IP protocol name (``tcp``, ``udp``, ``icmp``, ``icmpv6``) or number (see [Protocol Numbers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml)).
 Use ``-1`` to specify all protocols. When authorizing security group rules, specifying ``-1`` or a protocol number other than ``tcp``, ``udp``, ``icmp``, or ``icmpv6`` allows traffic on all ports, regardless of any port range you specify. For ``tcp``, ``udp``, and ``icmp``, you must specify a port range. For ``icmpv6``, the port range is optional; if you omit the port range, traffic for all types and codes is allowed.

### Optional

- `cidr_ip` (String) The IPv4 address range, in CIDR format.
 You must specify exactly one of the following: ``CidrIp``, ``CidrIpv6``, ``DestinationPrefixListId``, or ``DestinationSecurityGroupId``.
 For examples of rules that you can add to security groups for specific access scenarios, see [Security group rules for different use cases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-rules-reference.html) in the *User Guide*.
- `cidr_ipv_6` (String) The IPv6 address range, in CIDR format.
 You must specify exactly one of the following: ``CidrIp``, ``CidrIpv6``, ``DestinationPrefixListId``, or ``DestinationSecurityGroupId``.
 For examples of rules that you can add to security groups for specific access scenarios, see [Security group rules for different use cases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-rules-reference.html) in the *User Guide*.
- `description` (String) The description of an egress (outbound) security group rule.
 Constraints: Up to 255 characters in length. Allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, spaces, and ._-:/()#,@[]+=;{}!$*
- `destination_prefix_list_id` (String) The prefix list IDs for an AWS service. This is the AWS service to access through a VPC endpoint from instances associated with the security group.
 You must specify exactly one of the following: ``CidrIp``, ``CidrIpv6``, ``DestinationPrefixListId``, or ``DestinationSecurityGroupId``.
- `destination_security_group_id` (String) The ID of the security group.
 You must specify exactly one of the following: ``CidrIp``, ``CidrIpv6``, ``DestinationPrefixListId``, or ``DestinationSecurityGroupId``.
- `from_port` (Number) If the protocol is TCP or UDP, this is the start of the port range. If the protocol is ICMP or ICMPv6, this is the ICMP type or -1 (all ICMP types).
- `to_port` (Number) If the protocol is TCP or UDP, this is the end of the port range. If the protocol is ICMP or ICMPv6, this is the ICMP code or -1 (all ICMP codes). If the start port is -1 (all ICMP types), then the end port must be -1 (all ICMP codes).

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `security_group_egress_id` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_security_group_egress.example
  identity = {
    id = "id"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `id` (String)

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The ID of the AWS account
- `region` (String) The AWS region where the resource is located

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_ec2_security_group_egress.example
  id = "id"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_ec2_security_group_egress.example "id"
```
