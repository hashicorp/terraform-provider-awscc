## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_networkmanager_direct_connect_gateway_attachment.example
  identity = {
    attachment_id = "attachment_id"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `attachment_id` (String) Id of the attachment

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_networkmanager_direct_connect_gateway_attachment.example
  id = "attachment_id"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_networkmanager_direct_connect_gateway_attachment.example "attachment_id"
```
