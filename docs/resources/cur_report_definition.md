# awscc_cur_report_definition (Resource)

The AWS::CUR::ReportDefinition resource creates a Cost & Usage Report with user-defined settings. You can use this resource to define settings like time granularity (hourly, daily, monthly), file format (Parquet, CSV), and S3 bucket for delivery of these reports.

## Example Usage

### Configure Cost and Usage Report with Athena Integration

Creates an hourly Cost and Usage Report (CUR) with Athena integration that stores Parquet-formatted reports in S3, including resource-level information and automatic report overwriting capability.

## Schema

### Required

- `compression` (String) The compression format that AWS uses for the report.
- `format` (String) The format that AWS saves the report in.

- `report_name` (String) The name of the report that you want to create. The name must be unique, is case sensitive, and can't include spaces.
- `report_versioning` (String) Whether you want Amazon Web Services to overwrite the previous version of each report or to deliver the report in addition to the previous versions.
- `s3_bucket` (String) The S3 bucket where AWS delivers the report.
- `s3_prefix` (String) The prefix that AWS adds to the report name when AWS delivers the report. Your prefix can't include spaces.
- `s3_region` (String) The region of the S3 bucket that AWS delivers the report into.
- `time_unit` (String) The granularity of the line items in the report.

### Optional

- `additional_artifacts` (List of String) A list of manifests that you want Amazon Web Services to create for this report.
- `additional_schema_elements` (List of String) A list of strings that indicate additional content that Amazon Web Services includes in the report, such as individual resource IDs.
- `billing_view_arn` (String) The Amazon resource name of the billing view. You can get this value by using the billing view service public APIs.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_cur_report_definition.example
  identity = {
    report_name = "report_name"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `report_name` (String) The name of the report that you want to create

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_cur_report_definition.example
  id = "report_name"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_cur_report_definition.example "report_name"
```
