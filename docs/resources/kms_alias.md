# awscc_kms_alias (Resource)

The ``AWS::KMS::Alias`` resource specifies a display name for a [KMS key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#kms_keys). You can use an alias to identify a KMS key in the KMS console, in the [DescribeKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html) operation, and in [cryptographic operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations), such as [Decrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Decrypt.html) and [GenerateDataKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKey.html).
  Adding, deleting, or updating an alias can allow or deny permission to the KMS key. For details, see [ABAC for](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/abac.html) in the *Developer Guide*.
  Using an alias to refer to a KMS key can help you simplify key management. For example, an alias in your code can be associated with different KMS keys i

## Example Usage

### KMS Alias
To use `awscc_kms_alias` with `awscc_kms_key`:

```terraform
resource "awscc_kms_key" "this" {
  key_policy = jsonencode({
    "Version" : "2012-10-17",
    "Id" : "KMS-Key-Policy",
    "Statement" : [
      {
        "Sid" : "Enable IAM User Permissions",
        "Effect" : "Allow",
        "Principal" : {
          "AWS" : "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
        },
        "Action" : "kms:*",
        "Resource" : "*"
      },
    ],
    }
  )
}

resource "awscc_kms_alias" "this" {
  alias_name    = "alias/example-kms-alias"
  target_key_id = awscc_kms_key.this.key_id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `alias_name` (String) Specifies the alias name. This value must begin with ``alias/`` followed by a name, such as ``alias/ExampleAlias``. 
  If you change the value of the ``AliasName`` property, the existing alias is deleted and a new alias is created for the specified KMS key. This change can disrupt applications that use the alias. It can also allow or deny access to a KMS key affected by attribute-based access control (ABAC).
  The alias must be string of 1-256 characters. It can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). The alias name cannot begin with ``alias/aws/``. The ``alias/aws/`` prefix is reserved for [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk).
- `target_key_id` (String) Associates the alias with the specified [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk). The KMS key must be in the same AWS-account and Region.
 A valid key ID is required. If you supply a null or empty string value, this operation returns an error.
 For help finding the key ID and ARN, see [Finding the key ID and ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/viewing-keys.html#find-cmk-id-arn) in the *Developer Guide*.
 Specify the key ID or the key ARN of the KMS key.
 For example:
  +  Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`` 
  +  Key ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`` 
  
 To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use [ListKeys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_ListKeys.html) or [DescribeKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html).

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_kms_alias.example <resource ID>
```
