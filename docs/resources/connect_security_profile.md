```terraform
# Create an Amazon Connect instance first
resource "awscc_connect_instance" "example" {
  attributes = {
    inbound_calls  = true
    outbound_calls = true
  }
  identity_management_type = "CONNECT_MANAGED"
  instance_alias           = "example-security-profile-instance"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

# Create the security profile
resource "awscc_connect_security_profile" "example" {
  instance_arn          = awscc_connect_instance.example.arn
  security_profile_name = "example-security-profile"
  description           = "Example security profile created via AWSCC"

  permissions = [
    "BasicAgentAccess",
    "OutboundCallAccess"
  ]

  applications = [{
    namespace               = "Connect"
    application_permissions = ["AccessAgentApplication"]
  }]

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_connect_security_profile.example
  identity = {
    security_profile_arn = "security_profile_arn"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `security_profile_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the security profile

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed
- `region` (String) Region where this resource is managed

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_connect_security_profile.example
  id = "security_profile_arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_connect_security_profile.example "security_profile_arn"
