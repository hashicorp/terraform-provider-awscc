# awscc_evidently_experiment (Resource)

Resource Type definition for AWS::Evidently::Experiment.

## Example Usage

### Configure A/B Testing Experiment with Amazon CloudWatch Evidently

Creates an Evidently experiment for A/B testing with a 60/40 split between control and treatment groups, measuring page load time metrics with custom sampling rate and automatic experiment start.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_evidently_experiment.example
  identity = {
    arn = "arn"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `arn` (String)

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed
- `region` (String) Region where this resource is managed

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_evidently_experiment.example
  id = "arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_evidently_experiment.example "arn"
```
