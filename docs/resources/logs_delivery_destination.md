```terraform
# CloudWatch Logs log group to use as a destination
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "example_destination" {
  name              = "example-destination-log-group"
  retention_in_days = 14

  tags = {
    Name        = "example-destination-log-group"
    Environment = "example"
  }
}

# Logs Delivery Destination
resource "awscc_logs_delivery_destination" "example" {
  name                     = "example-delivery-destination"
  destination_resource_arn = aws_cloudwatch_log_group.example_destination.arn
  output_format            = "json"

  tags = [
    {
      key   = "Name"
      value = "example-delivery-destination"

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_logs_delivery_destination.example
  identity = {
    name = "name"
  }
}
```
