Resource Type definition for AWS::ApiGateway::Stage



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `rest_api_id` (String) The ID of the RestApi resource that you're deploying with this stage.

### Optional

- `access_log_setting` (Attributes) Specifies settings for logging access in this stage. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--access_log_setting))
- `cache_cluster_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether cache clustering is enabled for the stage.
- `cache_cluster_size` (String) The stage's cache cluster size.
- `canary_setting` (Attributes) Specifies settings for the canary deployment in this stage. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--canary_setting))
- `client_certificate_id` (String) The ID of the client certificate that API Gateway uses to call your integration endpoints in the stage.
- `deployment_id` (String) The ID of the deployment that the stage is associated with. This parameter is required to create a stage.
- `description` (String) A description of the stage.
- `documentation_version` (String) The version ID of the API documentation snapshot.
- `method_settings` (Attributes Set) Settings for all methods in the stage. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--method_settings))
- `stage_name` (String) The name of the stage, which API Gateway uses as the first path segment in the invoked Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
- `tags` (Attributes List) An array of arbitrary tags (key-value pairs) to associate with the stage. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
- `tracing_enabled` (Boolean) Specifies whether active X-Ray tracing is enabled for this stage.
- `variables` (Map of String) A map (string-to-string map) that defines the stage variables, where the variable name is the key and the variable value is the value.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Nested Schema for `access_log_setting`

Optional:

- `destination_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CloudWatch Logs log group or Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to receive access logs. If you specify a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream, the stream name must begin with amazon-apigateway-. This parameter is required to enable access logging.
- `format` (String) A single line format of the access logs of data, as specified by selected $context variables (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-mapping-template-reference.html#context-variable-reference). The format must include at least $context.requestId. This parameter is required to enable access logging.


<a id="nestedatt--canary_setting"></a>
### Nested Schema for `canary_setting`

Optional:

- `deployment_id` (String) The identifier of the deployment that the stage points to.
- `percent_traffic` (Number) The percentage (0-100) of traffic diverted to a canary deployment.
- `stage_variable_overrides` (Map of String) Stage variables overridden for a canary release deployment, including new stage variables introduced in the canary. These stage variables are represented as a string-to-string map between stage variable names and their values.
- `use_stage_cache` (Boolean) Whether the canary deployment uses the stage cache or not.


<a id="nestedatt--method_settings"></a>
### Nested Schema for `method_settings`

Optional:

- `cache_data_encrypted` (Boolean) Indicates whether the cached responses are encrypted.
- `cache_ttl_in_seconds` (Number) The time-to-live (TTL) period, in seconds, that specifies how long API Gateway caches responses.
- `caching_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether responses are cached and returned for requests. You must enable a cache cluster on the stage to cache responses.
- `data_trace_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether data trace logging is enabled for methods in the stage. API Gateway pushes these logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
- `http_method` (String) The HTTP method. You can use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard to apply method settings to multiple methods.
- `logging_level` (String) The logging level for this method. For valid values, see the loggingLevel property of the Stage (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/resource/stage/#loggingLevel) resource in the Amazon API Gateway API Reference.
- `metrics_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether Amazon CloudWatch metrics are enabled for methods in the stage.
- `resource_path` (String) The resource path for this method. Forward slashes (/) are encoded as ~1 and the initial slash must include a forward slash. For example, the path value /resource/subresource must be encoded as /~1resource~1subresource. To specify the root path, use only a slash (/). You can use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard to apply method settings to multiple methods.
- `throttling_burst_limit` (Number) The number of burst requests per second that API Gateway permits across all APIs, stages, and methods in your AWS account.
- `throttling_rate_limit` (Number) The number of steady-state requests per second that API Gateway permits across all APIs, stages, and methods in your AWS account.


<a id="nestedatt--tags"></a>
### Nested Schema for `tags`

Optional:

- `key` (String) The key name of the tag. You can specify a value that is 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length and cannot be prefixed with aws:.
- `value` (String) The value for the tag. You can specify a value that is 0 to 256 Unicode characters in length and cannot be prefixed with aws:.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_apigateway_stage.example <resource ID>
```
