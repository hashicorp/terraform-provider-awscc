Resource Type definition for AWS::IVS::RecordingConfiguration

## Example Usage

### IVS Recording Configuration with S3 Integration

Creates an IVS recording configuration that saves streams to S3 with HD thumbnail generation every 30 seconds, including necessary IAM roles and permissions for the IVS service.
