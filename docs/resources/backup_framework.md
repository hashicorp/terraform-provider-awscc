## Schema

### Required

- `framework_controls` (Attributes Set) Contains detailed information about all of the controls of a framework. Each framework must contain at least one control. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--framework_controls))

### Optional

- `framework_description` (String) An optional description of the framework with a maximum 1,024 characters.
- `framework_name` (String) The unique name of a framework. This name is between 1 and 256 characters, starting with a letter, and consisting of letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_).
- `framework_tags` (Attributes List) Metadata that you can assign to help organize the frameworks that you create. Each tag is a key-value pair. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--framework_tags))

### Read-Only

- `creation_time` (Number) The date and time that a framework is created, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of `CreationTime` is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.
- `deployment_status` (String) The deployment status of a framework. The statuses are: `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS | UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS | DELETE_IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETED | FAILED`
- `framework_arn` (String) An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies Framework as a resource
- `framework_status` (String) A framework consists of one or more controls. Each control governs a resource, such as backup plans, backup selections, backup vaults, or recovery points. You can also turn AWS Config recording on or off for each resource. The statuses are:

`ACTIVE` when recording is turned on for all resources governed by the framework.

`PARTIALLY_ACTIVE` when recording is turned off for at least one resource governed by the framework.

`INACTIVE` when recording is turned off for all resources governed by the framework.

`UNAVAILABLE` when AWS Backup is unable to validate recording status at this time.
- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
