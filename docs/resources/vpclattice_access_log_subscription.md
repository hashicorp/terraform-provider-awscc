  Enables access logs to be sent to Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon S3, and Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. The service network owner can use the access logs to audit the services in the network. The service network owner will only see access logs from clients and services that are associated with their service network. Access log entries represent traffic originated from VPCs associated with that network.

# awscc_vpclattice_access_log_subscription (Resource)

Enables access logs to be sent to Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon S3, and Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. The service network owner can use the access logs to audit the services in the network. The service network owner will only see access logs from clients and services that are associated with their service network. Access log entries represent traffic originated from VPCs associated with that network.

## Example Usage

### Configure VPC Lattice Access Logging

Creates a VPC Lattice access log subscription that sends service network logs to an S3 bucket, with the necessary bucket policy to allow VPC Lattice to write logs.

```terraform

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_vpclattice_access_log_subscription.example
  identity = {
    arn = "arn"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `arn` (String)

#### Optional

- `account_id` (String) The ID of the AWS account
- `region` (String) The AWS region where the resource is located

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = awscc_vpclattice_access_log_subscription.example
  id = "arn"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
$ terraform import awscc_vpclattice_access_log_subscription.example "arn"
```
