# AWS Cloud Control Provider

Use the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Control provider to interact with the many resources supported by AWS via the Cloud Control API. You must configure the provider with the proper credentials before you can use it.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

To learn the basics of Terraform using this provider, follow the hands-on [get started tutorials](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws/aws-cloud-control) on HashiCorp's Developer pages.

~> **NOTE:** The AWS Cloud Control provider requires the use of Terraform 1.0.7 or later.

### Things to Know

The Cloud Control provider resources and data sources are fully generated based on CloudFormation schema sourced from the CloudFormation registry.

The providers resources and data sources are refreshed weekly (both enhancements and net-new resources) based on available updates in the CloudFormation registry in us-east-1 at the time of generation. If no updates are found, no release will be made.

Some resources generation may be suppressed, and therefore unavailable in the provider despite being supported by CloudFormation. This is typically due to the provider being unable to handle certain aspects of that specific CloudFormation schema's structure. This list is maintained [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-awscc/issues/156), and efforts are made by the provider team to maximize the number of supported resources.

The CloudFormation schema upon which this provider relies on does not expose attribute defaults to Terraform in a consistent way. This means that early versions of this provider would encounter drift unexpectedly when practioners did not set a value for an attribute which had an default undeclared in the CloudFormation schema. In order to present a better overall experience we marked all optional values with the `Computed` schema behavior. This reduced the incidence of unenexpected drift but comes at a cost in that we are no longer able to detect drift to these values if no value is set by the practioner. Additionally computed values in sets are particularly problematic in relation to drift detection, and resources featuring this type can continue to display issues with unexpected drift.

## Example Usage

Terraform 1.0.7 and later:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    awscc = {
      source  = "hashicorp/awscc"
      version = "~> 1.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the AWS CC Provider
provider "awscc" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Create a Log Group
resource "awscc_logs_log_group" "example" {
  log_group_name = "example"
}
```

## Authentication

The AWS CC Provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for
authentication. The following methods are supported, in this order, and
explained below:

- Static credentials
- Environment variables
- Shared credentials/configuration file
- CodeBuild, ECS, and EKS Roles
- EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS and IMDSv2)

### Static Credentials

!> **Warning:** Hard-coded credentials are not recommended in any Terraform
configuration and risks secret leakage should this file ever be committed to a
public version control system.

Static credentials can be provided by adding an `access_key` and `secret_key`
in-line in the AWS CC Provider block:

Usage:

```terraform
provider "awscc" {
  region     = "us-west-2"
  access_key = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
  secret_key = "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
}
```

### Environment Variables

You can provide your credentials via the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, environment variables, representing your AWS
Access Key and AWS Secret Key, respectively.  Note that setting your
AWS credentials using either these (or legacy) environment variables
will override the use of `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` and `AWS_PROFILE`.
The `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` environment variables
are also used, if applicable:

```terraform
provider "awscc" {}
```

Usage:

```sh
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
$ export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-west-2"
$ terraform plan
```

### Shared Configuration and Credentials Files

You can use [AWS shared configuration or credentials files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) to specify configuration and credentials.
The default locations are `$HOME/.aws/config` and `$HOME/.aws/credentials` on Linux and macOS,
or `"%USERPROFILE%\.aws\config"` and `"%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials"` on Windows.
You can optionally specify a different location in the Terraform configuration by providing the `shared_config_files` and `shared_credentials_files` arguments
or using the `AWS_SHARED_CONFIG_FILE` and `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variables.
This method also supports the `profile` configuration and corresponding `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable:

Usage:

```terraform
provider "awscc" {
  region                   = "us-west-2"
  shared_config_files      = ["/Users/tf_user/.aws/conf"]
  shared_credentials_files = ["/Users/tf_user/.aws/creds"]
  profile                  = "customprofile"
}
```

Please note that the [AWS Go SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/), the underlying authentication handler used by the Terraform AWS CC Provider, does not support all AWS CLI features.

### CodeBuild, ECS, and EKS Roles

If you're running Terraform on CodeBuild or ECS and have configured an [IAM Task Role](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html), Terraform will use the container's Task Role. This support is based on the underlying `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI` and `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_FULL_URI` environment variables being automatically set by those services or manually for advanced usage.

If you're running Terraform on EKS and have configured [IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html), Terraform will use the pod's role. This support is based on the underlying `AWS_ROLE_ARN` and `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` environment variables being automatically set by Kubernetes or manually for advanced usage.

### Custom User-Agent Information

By default, the underlying AWS client used by the Terraform AWS CC Provider creates requests with User-Agent headers including information about Terraform and AWS Go SDK versions.
To provide additional information in the User-Agent headers, set the User-Agent product or comment information using the `user_agent` argument.
For example,

```terraform
provider "awscc" {
  user_agent = [
    {
      product_name    = "example-module"
      product_version = "1.0"
    },
    {
      product_name    = "BuildID"
      product_version = "1234"
    }
  ]
}
```

will append `example-module/1.0 BuildID/1234` to the User-Agent.

In addition, the `TF_APPEND_USER_AGENT` environment variable can be set and its value will be directly added to HTTP requests. e.g.

```sh
$ export TF_APPEND_USER_AGENT="JenkinsAgent/i-12345678 BuildID/1234 (Optional Extra Information)"
```

### EC2 Instance Metadata Service

If you're running Terraform from an EC2 instance with IAM Instance Profile using IAM Role,
Terraform will query [the metadata API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html#instance-metadata-security-credentials) endpoint for credentials and region.

This is a preferred approach over any other when running in EC2 as you can avoid
hard coding credentials. Instead these are leased on-the-fly by Terraform
which reduces the chance of leakage.

You can provide the custom metadata API endpoint via the `AWS_METADATA_URL` variable
which expects the endpoint URL, including the version, and defaults to `http://169.254.169.254:80/latest`.

### Assume Role

If provided with a role ARN, Terraform will attempt to assume this role
using the supplied credentials.

Usage:

```terraform
provider "awscc" {
  assume_role = {
    role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME"
    session_name = "SESSION_NAME"
    external_id  = "EXTERNAL_ID"
  }
}
```

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Use AssumeRole to Provision AWS Resources Across Accounts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws/aws-assumerole) tutorial on HashiCorp Developer page.

### Assume Role Using Web Identity

If provided with a role ARN and a token from a web identity provider,
the AWS CC Provider will attempt to assume this role using the supplied credentials.

Usage:

```terraform
provider "awscc" {
  assume_role_with_web_identity = {
    role_arn                = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ROLE_NAME"
    session_name            = "SESSION_NAME"
    web_identity_token_file = "/Users/tf_user/secrets/web-identity-token"
  }
}
```

### Using an External Credentials Process

To use an [external process to source credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sourcing-external.html),
the process must be configured in a named profile, including the `default` profile.
The profile is configured in a shared configuration file.

For example:

```terraform
provider "awscc" {
  profile = "customprofile"
}
```

```ini
[profile customprofile]
credential_process = custom-process --username jdoe
```
