- `description` (String) A description of this trigger.
- `event_batching_condition` (Attributes) Batch condition that must be met (specified number of events received or batch time window expired) before EventBridge event trigger fires. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--event_batching_condition))
- `name` (String) The name of the trigger.
- `predicate` (Attributes) The predicate of this trigger, which defines when it will fire. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--predicate))
- `schedule` (String) A cron expression used to specify the schedule.
- `start_on_creation` (Boolean) Set to true to start SCHEDULED and CONDITIONAL triggers when created. True is not supported for ON_DEMAND triggers.

### Nested Schema for `actions`

Read-Only:

- `arguments` (String) The job arguments used when this trigger fires. For this job run, they replace the default arguments set in the job definition itself.
- `crawler_name` (String) The name of the crawler to be used with this action.
- `job_name` (String) The name of a job to be executed.
- `notification_property` (Attributes) Specifies configuration properties of a job run notification. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--actions--notification_property))
- `security_configuration` (String) The name of the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used with this action.
- `timeout` (Number) The JobRun timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that a job run can consume resources before it is terminated and enters TIMEOUT status. The default is 2,880 minutes (48 hours). This overrides the timeout value set in the parent job.

### Nested Schema for `actions.notification_property`
