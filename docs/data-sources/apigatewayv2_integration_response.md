Data Source schema for AWS::ApiGatewayV2::IntegrationResponse



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `api_id` (String) The API identifier.
- `content_handling_strategy` (String) Supported only for WebSocket APIs. Specifies how to handle response payload content type conversions. Supported values are ``CONVERT_TO_BINARY`` and ``CONVERT_TO_TEXT``, with the following behaviors:
  ``CONVERT_TO_BINARY``: Converts a response payload from a Base64-encoded string to the corresponding binary blob.
  ``CONVERT_TO_TEXT``: Converts a response payload from a binary blob to a Base64-encoded string.
 If this property is not defined, the response payload will be passed through from the integration response to the route response or method response without modification.
- `integration_id` (String) The integration ID.
- `integration_response_id` (String)
- `integration_response_key` (String) The integration response key.
- `response_parameters` (String) A key-value map specifying response parameters that are passed to the method response from the backend. The key is a method response header parameter name and the mapped value is an integration response header value, a static value enclosed within a pair of single quotes, or a JSON expression from the integration response body. The mapping key must match the pattern of ``method.response.header.{name}``, where name is a valid and unique header name. The mapped non-static value must match the pattern of ``integration.response.header.{name}`` or ``integration.response.body.{JSON-expression}``, where ``{name}`` is a valid and unique response header name and ``{JSON-expression}`` is a valid JSON expression without the ``$`` prefix.
- `response_templates` (String) The collection of response templates for the integration response as a string-to-string map of key-value pairs. Response templates are represented as a key/value map, with a content-type as the key and a template as the value.
- `template_selection_expression` (String) The template selection expression for the integration response. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.
