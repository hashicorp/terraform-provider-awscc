You can use an existing name or use a new name to create a new metric group. Currently, this parameter can have only one string.
- `new_game_session_protection_policy` (String) A game session protection policy to apply to all game sessions hosted on instances in this fleet. When protected, active game sessions cannot be terminated during a scale-down event. If this parameter is not set, instances in this fleet default to no protection. You can change a fleet's protection policy to affect future game sessions on the fleet. You can also set protection for individual game sessions.
- `per_instance_container_group_definition_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the per instance container group definition. This field will be empty if PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinitionName is not specified.
- `per_instance_container_group_definition_name` (String) The name of the container group definition that will be created per instance. This field is optional if you specify GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionName.
