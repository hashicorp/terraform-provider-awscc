Data Source schema for AWS::Backup::Framework



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `creation_time` (String) The date and time that a framework is created, in ISO 8601 representation. The value of CreationTime is accurate to milliseconds. For example, 2020-07-10T15:00:00.000-08:00 represents the 10th of July 2020 at 3:00 PM 8 hours behind UTC.
- `deployment_status` (String) The deployment status of a framework. The statuses are: `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS | UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS | DELETE_IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETED | FAILED`
- `framework_arn` (String) An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies Framework as a resource
- `framework_controls` (Attributes Set) Contains detailed information about all of the controls of a framework. Each framework must contain at least one control. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--framework_controls))
- `framework_description` (String) An optional description of the framework with a maximum 1,024 characters.
- `framework_name` (String) The unique name of a framework. This name is between 1 and 256 characters, starting with a letter, and consisting of letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_).
- `framework_status` (String) A framework consists of one or more controls. Each control governs a resource, such as backup plans, backup selections, backup vaults, or recovery points. You can also turn AWS Config recording on or off for each resource. The statuses are:

`ACTIVE` when recording is turned on for all resources governed by the framework.

`PARTIALLY_ACTIVE` when recording is turned off for at least one resource governed by the framework.

`INACTIVE` when recording is turned off for all resources governed by the framework.

`UNAVAILABLE` when AWS Backup is unable to validate recording status at this time.
- `framework_tags` (Attributes List) Metadata that you can assign to help organize the frameworks that you create. Each tag is a key-value pair. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--framework_tags))

### Nested Schema for `framework_controls`

Read-Only:

- `control_input_parameters` (Attributes Set) A list of ParameterName and ParameterValue pairs. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--framework_controls--control_input_parameters))
- `control_name` (String) The name of a control. This name is between 1 and 256 characters.
- `control_scope` (Attributes) The scope of a control. The control scope defines what the control will evaluate. Three examples of control scopes are: a specific backup plan, all backup plans with a specific tag, or all backup plans. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--framework_controls--control_scope))
