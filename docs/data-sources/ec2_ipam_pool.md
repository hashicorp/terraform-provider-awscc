<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `address_family` (String) The address family of the address space in this pool. Either IPv4 or IPv6.
- `allocation_default_netmask_length` (Number) The default netmask length for allocations made from this pool. This value is used when the netmask length of an allocation isn't specified.
- `allocation_max_netmask_length` (Number) The maximum allowed netmask length for allocations made from this pool.
- `allocation_min_netmask_length` (Number) The minimum allowed netmask length for allocations made from this pool.
- `allocation_resource_tags` (Attributes Set) When specified, an allocation will not be allowed unless a resource has a matching set of tags. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--allocation_resource_tags))
- `arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IPAM Pool.
- `auto_import` (Boolean) Determines what to do if IPAM discovers resources that haven't been assigned an allocation. If set to true, an allocation will be made automatically.
- `aws_service` (String) Limits which service in Amazon Web Services that the pool can be used in.
- `description` (String)
- `ipam_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IPAM this pool is a part of.
- `ipam_pool_id` (String) Id of the IPAM Pool.
- `ipam_scope_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the scope this pool is a part of.
- `ipam_scope_id` (String) The Id of the scope this pool is a part of.
- `ipam_scope_type` (String) Determines whether this scope contains publicly routable space or space for a private network
- `locale` (String) The region of this pool. If not set, this will default to "None" which will disable non-custom allocations. If the locale has been specified for the source pool, this value must match.
- `pool_depth` (Number) The depth of this pool in the source pool hierarchy.
- `provisioned_cidrs` (Attributes Set) A list of cidrs representing the address space available for allocation in this pool. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--provisioned_cidrs))
- `public_ip_source` (String) The IP address source for pools in the public scope. Only used for provisioning IP address CIDRs to pools in the public scope. Default is `byoip`.
- `publicly_advertisable` (Boolean) Determines whether or not address space from this pool is publicly advertised. Must be set if and only if the pool is IPv6.
- `source_ipam_pool_id` (String) The Id of this pool's source. If set, all space provisioned in this pool must be free space provisioned in the parent pool.
- `state` (String) The state of this pool. This can be one of the following values: "create-in-progress", "create-complete", "modify-in-progress", "modify-complete", "delete-in-progress", or "delete-complete"
- `state_message` (String) An explanation of how the pool arrived at it current state.
- `tags` (Attributes Set) An array of key-value pairs to apply to this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
