<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- **id** (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- **address_family** (String) The address family of the address space in this pool. Either IPv4 or IPv6.
- **allocation_default_netmask_length** (Number) The default netmask length for allocations made from this pool. This value is used when the netmask length of an allocation isn't specified.
- **allocation_max_netmask_length** (Number) The maximum allowed netmask length for allocations made from this pool.
- **allocation_min_netmask_length** (Number) The minimum allowed netmask length for allocations made from this pool.
- **allocation_resource_tags** (Attributes Set) When specified, an allocation will not be allowed unless a resource has a matching set of tags. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--allocation_resource_tags))
- **arn** (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IPAM Pool.
- **auto_import** (Boolean) Determines what to do if IPAM discovers resources that haven't been assigned an allocation. If set to true, an allocation will be made automatically.
- **description** (String)
- **ipam_arn** (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IPAM this pool is a part of.
- **ipam_pool_id** (String) Id of the IPAM Pool.
- **ipam_scope_arn** (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the scope this pool is a part of.
- **ipam_scope_id** (String) The Id of the scope this pool is a part of.
- **ipam_scope_type** (String) Determines whether this scope contains publicly routable space or space for a private network
- **locale** (String) The region of this pool. If not set, this will default to "None" which will disable non-custom allocations. If the locale has been specified for the source pool, this value must match.
- **pool_depth** (Number) The depth of this pool in the source pool hierarchy.
- **provisioned_cidrs** (Attributes Set) A list of cidrs representing the address space available for allocation in this pool. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--provisioned_cidrs))
- **publicly_advertisable** (Boolean) Determines whether or not address space from this pool is publicly advertised. Must be set if and only if the pool is IPv6.
- **source_ipam_pool_id** (String) The Id of this pool's source. If set, all space provisioned in this pool must be free space provisioned in the parent pool.
- **state** (String) The state of this pool. This can be one of the following values: "create-in-progress", "create-complete", "modify-in-progress", "modify-complete", "delete-in-progress", or "delete-complete"
- **state_message** (String) An explanation of how the pool arrived at it current state.
- **tags** (Attributes Set) An array of key-value pairs to apply to this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
