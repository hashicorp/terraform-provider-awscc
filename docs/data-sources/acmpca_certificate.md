Data Source schema for AWS::ACMPCA::Certificate



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `api_passthrough` (Attributes) Specifies X.509 certificate information to be included in the issued certificate. An ``APIPassthrough`` or ``APICSRPassthrough`` template variant must be selected, or else this parameter is ignored. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--api_passthrough))
- `arn` (String)
- `certificate` (String)
- `certificate_authority_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the private CA issues the certificate.
- `certificate_signing_request` (String) The certificate signing request (CSR) for the certificate.
- `signing_algorithm` (String) The name of the algorithm that will be used to sign the certificate to be issued. 
 This parameter should not be confused with the ``SigningAlgorithm`` parameter used to sign a CSR in the ``CreateCertificateAuthority`` action.
  The specified signing algorithm family (RSA or ECDSA) must match the algorithm family of the CA's secret key.
- `template_arn` (String) Specifies a custom configuration template to use when issuing a certificate. If this parameter is not provided, PCAshort defaults to the ``EndEntityCertificate/V1`` template. For more information about PCAshort templates, see [Using Templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/UsingTemplates.html).
- `validity` (Attributes) The period of time during which the certificate will be valid. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--validity))
- `validity_not_before` (Attributes) Information describing the start of the validity period of the certificate. This parameter sets the ?Not Before" date for the certificate.
 By default, when issuing a certificate, PCAshort sets the "Not Before" date to the issuance time minus 60 minutes. This compensates for clock inconsistencies across computer systems. The ``ValidityNotBefore`` parameter can be used to customize the ?Not Before? value. 
 Unlike the ``Validity`` parameter, the ``ValidityNotBefore`` parameter is optional.
 The ``ValidityNotBefore`` value is expressed as an explicit date and time, using the ``Validity`` type value ``ABSOLUTE``. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--validity_not_before))

### Nested Schema for `api_passthrough`

Read-Only:

- `extensions` (Attributes) Specifies X.509 extension information for a certificate. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--api_passthrough--extensions))
- `subject` (Attributes) Contains information about the certificate subject. The Subject field in the certificate identifies the entity that owns or controls the public key in the certificate. The entity can be a user, computer, device, or service. The Subject must contain an X.500 distinguished name (DN). A DN is a sequence of relative distinguished names (RDNs). The RDNs are separated by commas in the certificate. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--api_passthrough--subject))

<a id="nestedatt--api_passthrough--extensions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `api_passthrough.extensions`

Read-Only:

For more information, see NIST's definition of [Object Identifier (OID)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/Object_Identifier).
 In an end-entity certificate, these terms indicate the policy under which the certificate was issued and the purposes for which it may be used. In a CA certificate, these terms limit the set of policies for certification paths that include this certificate. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--api_passthrough--extensions--certificate_policies))
- `custom_extensions` (Attributes List) Contains a sequence of one or more X.509 extensions, each of which consists of an object identifier (OID), a base64-encoded value, and the critical flag. For more information, see the [Global OID reference database.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://oidref.com/2.5.29) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--api_passthrough--extensions--custom_extensions))
- `extended_key_usage` (Attributes List) Specifies additional purposes for which the certified public key may be used other than basic purposes indicated in the ``KeyUsage`` extension. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--api_passthrough--extensions--extended_key_usage))
- `key_usage` (Attributes) Defines one or more purposes for which the key contained in the certificate can be used. Default value for each option is false. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--api_passthrough--extensions--key_usage))
- `subject_alternative_names` (Attributes List) The subject alternative name extension allows identities to be bound to the subject of the certificate. These identities may be included in addition to or in place of the identity in the subject field of the certificate. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--api_passthrough--extensions--subject_alternative_names))
