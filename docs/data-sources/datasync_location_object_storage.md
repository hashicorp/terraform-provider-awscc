<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `access_key` (String) Optional. The access key is used if credentials are required to access the self-managed object storage server.
- `agent_arns` (List of String) Specifies the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the DataSync agents that can connect with your object storage system. If you are setting up an agentless cross-cloud transfer, you do not need to specify a value for this parameter.
- `bucket_name` (String) The name of the bucket on the self-managed object storage server.
- `cmk_secret_config` (Attributes) Specifies configuration information for a DataSync-managed secret, such as an authentication token or set of credentials that DataSync uses to access a specific transfer location, and a customer-managed AWS KMS key. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cmk_secret_config))
- `custom_secret_config` (Attributes) Specifies configuration information for a customer-managed secret, such as an authentication token or set of credentials that DataSync uses to access a specific transfer location, and an IAM role that DataSync can assume and access the customer-managed secret. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--custom_secret_config))
- `location_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the location that is created.
- `location_uri` (String) The URL of the object storage location that was described.
- `managed_secret_config` (Attributes) Specifies configuration information for a DataSync-managed secret, such as an authentication token or set of credentials that DataSync uses to access a specific transfer location. DataSync uses the default AWS-managed KMS key to encrypt this secret in AWS Secrets Manager. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--managed_secret_config))
- `secret_key` (String) Optional. The secret key is used if credentials are required to access the self-managed object storage server.
- `server_certificate` (String) X.509 PEM content containing a certificate authority or chain to trust.
- `server_hostname` (String) The name of the self-managed object storage server. This value is the IP address or Domain Name Service (DNS) name of the object storage server.
