Data Source schema for AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `actions_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether actions should be executed during any changes to the alarm state. The default is TRUE.
- `alarm_actions` (List of String) The list of actions to execute when this alarm transitions into an ALARM state from any other state.
- `alarm_description` (String) The description of the alarm.
- `alarm_name` (String) The name of the alarm.
- `arn` (String) Amazon Resource Name is a unique name for each resource.
- `comparison_operator` (String) The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statistic and threshold.
- `datapoints_to_alarm` (Number) The number of datapoints that must be breaching to trigger the alarm.
- `dimensions` (Attributes List) The dimensions for the metric associated with the alarm. For an alarm based on a math expression, you can't specify Dimensions. Instead, you use Metrics. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--dimensions))
- `evaluate_low_sample_count_percentile` (String) Used only for alarms based on percentiles.
- `evaluation_periods` (Number) The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified threshold.
- `extended_statistic` (String) The percentile statistic for the metric associated with the alarm. Specify a value between p0.0 and p100.
- `insufficient_data_actions` (List of String) The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the INSUFFICIENT_DATA state from any other state.
- `metric_name` (String) The name of the metric associated with the alarm.
- `metrics` (Attributes List) An array that enables you to create an alarm based on the result of a metric math expression. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metrics))
- `namespace` (String) The namespace of the metric associated with the alarm.
- `ok_actions` (List of String) The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the OK state from any other state.
- `period` (Number) The period in seconds, over which the statistic is applied.
- `statistic` (String) The statistic for the metric associated with the alarm, other than percentile.
- `threshold` (Number) In an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, this is the ID of the ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND function used as the threshold for the alarm.
- `threshold_metric_id` (String) In an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, this is the ID of the ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND function used as the threshold for the alarm.
- `treat_missing_data` (String) Sets how this alarm is to handle missing data points. Valid values are breaching, notBreaching, ignore, and missing.
- `unit` (String) The unit of the metric associated with the alarm.

### Nested Schema for `metrics`

Read-Only:

- `account_id` (String) The ID of the account where the metrics are located, if this is a cross-account alarm.
- `expression` (String) The math expression to be performed on the returned data.
- `id` (String) A short name used to tie this object to the results in the response.
- `label` (String) A human-readable label for this metric or expression.
- `metric_stat` (Attributes) The metric to be returned, along with statistics, period, and units. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metrics--metric_stat))
- `period` (Number) The period in seconds, over which the statistic is applied.
- `return_data` (Boolean) This option indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric.

<a id="nestedatt--metrics--metric_stat"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metrics.metric_stat`

Read-Only:

- `metric` (Attributes) The metric to return, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metrics--metric_stat--metric))
- `period` (Number) The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points.
- `stat` (String) The statistic to return.
- `unit` (String) The unit to use for the returned data points.

### Nested Schema for `metrics.metric_stat.metric`

Read-Only:

- `dimensions` (Attributes List) The dimensions for the metric. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metrics--metric_stat--metric--dimensions))
- `metric_name` (String) The name of the metric.
- `namespace` (String) The namespace of the metric.
