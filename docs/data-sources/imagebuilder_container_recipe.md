Data Source schema for AWS::ImageBuilder::ContainerRecipe



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container recipe.
- `components` (Attributes List) Components for build and test that are included in the container recipe. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--components))
- `container_type` (String) Specifies the type of container, such as Docker.
- `description` (String) The description of the container recipe.
- `dockerfile_template_data` (String) Dockerfiles are text documents that are used to build Docker containers, and ensure that they contain all of the elements required by the application running inside. The template data consists of contextual variables where Image Builder places build information or scripts, based on your container image recipe.
- `dockerfile_template_uri` (String) The S3 URI for the Dockerfile that will be used to build your container image.
- `image_os_version_override` (String) Specifies the operating system version for the source image.
- `instance_configuration` (Attributes) A group of options that can be used to configure an instance for building and testing container images. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--instance_configuration))
- `kms_key_id` (String) Identifies which KMS key is used to encrypt the container image.
- `name` (String) The name of the container recipe.
- `parent_image` (String) The source image for the container recipe.
- `platform_override` (String) Specifies the operating system platform when you use a custom source image.
- `tags` (Map of String) Tags that are attached to the container recipe.
- `target_repository` (Attributes) The destination repository for the container image. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--target_repository))
- `version` (String) The semantic version of the container recipe (<major>.<minor>.<patch>).
- `working_directory` (String) The working directory to be used during build and test workflows.
