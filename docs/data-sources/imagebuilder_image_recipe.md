- `block_device_mappings` (Attributes List) The block device mappings to apply when creating images from this recipe. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--block_device_mappings))
- `components` (Attributes List) The components of the image recipe. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--components))
- `description` (String) The description of the image recipe.
- `name` (String) The name of the image recipe.
- `parent_image` (String) The parent image of the image recipe.

### Nested Schema for `additional_instance_configuration`

Read-Only:

- `systems_manager_agent` (Attributes) Contains settings for the SSM agent on your build instance. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--additional_instance_configuration--systems_manager_agent))
- `user_data_override` (String) Use this property to provide commands or a command script to run when you launch your build instance.

### Nested Schema for `additional_instance_configuration.systems_manager_agent`

Read-Only:

- `uninstall_after_build` (Boolean) Controls whether the SSM agent is removed from your final build image, prior to creating the new AMI. If this is set to true, then the agent is removed from the final image. If it's set to false, then the agent is left in, so that it is included in the new AMI. The default value is false.
