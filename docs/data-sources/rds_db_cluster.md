 This setting is required to create a Multi-AZ DB cluster.
 Valid for Cluster Type: Multi-AZ DB clusters only
- `db_cluster_parameter_group_name` (String) The name of the DB cluster parameter group to associate with this DB cluster.
  If you apply a parameter group to an existing DB cluster, then its DB instances might need to reboot. This can result in an outage while the DB instances are rebooting.
 If you apply a change to parameter group associated with a stopped DB cluster, then the update stack waits until the DB cluster is started.
  To list all of the available DB cluster parameter group names, use the following command:
  ``aws rds describe-db-cluster-parameter-groups --query "DBClusterParameterGroups[].DBClusterParameterGroupName" --output text`` 
 Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

- `enable_global_write_forwarding` (Boolean) Specifies whether to enable this DB cluster to forward write operations to the primary cluster of a global cluster (Aurora global database). By default, write operations are not allowed on Aurora DB clusters that are secondary clusters in an Aurora global database.
 You can set this value only on Aurora DB clusters that are members of an Aurora global database. With this parameter enabled, a secondary cluster can forward writes to the current primary cluster, and the resulting changes are replicated back to this cluster. For the primary DB cluster of an Aurora global database, this value is used immediately if the primary is demoted by a global cluster API operation, but it does nothing until then.
 Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters only
- `enable_http_endpoint` (Boolean) Specifies whether to enable the HTTP endpoint for the DB cluster. By default, the HTTP endpoint isn't enabled.
 When enabled, the HTTP endpoint provides a connectionless web service API (RDS Data API) for running SQL queries on the DB cluster. You can also query your database from inside the RDS console with the RDS query editor.
 RDS Data API is supported with the following DB clusters:
  +  Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless v2 and provisioned
  +  Aurora PostgreSQL and Aurora MySQL Serverless v1
  
 For more information, see [Using RDS Data API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/data-api.html) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

 Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
- `engine_lifecycle_support` (String) The life cycle type for this DB cluster.
  By default, this value is set to ``open-source-rds-extended-support``, which enrolls your DB cluster into Amazon RDS Extended Support. At the end of standard support, you can avoid charges for Extended Support by setting the value to ``open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled``. In this case, creating the DB cluster will fail if the DB major version is past its end of standard support date.
  You can use this setting to enroll your DB cluster into Amazon RDS Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support, you can run the selected major engine version on your DB cluster past the end of standard support for that engine version. For more information, see the following sections:

- `publicly_accessible` (Boolean) Specifies whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible.
 When the DB cluster is publicly accessible and you connect from outside of the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC), its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP address. When you connect from within the same VPC as the DB cluster, the endpoint resolves to the private IP address. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.
 When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.
 Valid for Cluster Type: Multi-AZ DB clusters only
 Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether ``DBSubnetGroupName`` is specified.
 If ``DBSubnetGroupName`` isn't specified, and ``PubliclyAccessible`` isn't specified, the following applies:
  +  If the default VPC in the target Region doesn?t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.
  +  If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is public.
  
 If ``DBSubnetGroupName`` is specified, and ``PubliclyAccessible`` isn't specified, the following applies:

 Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
- `restore_type` (String) The type of restore to be performed. You can specify one of the following values:
  +   ``full-copy`` - The new DB cluster is restored as a full copy of the source DB cluster.
  +   ``copy-on-write`` - The new DB cluster is restored as a clone of the source DB cluster.
  
 If you don't specify a ``RestoreType`` value, then the new DB cluster is restored as a full copy of the source DB cluster.
 Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
- `scaling_configuration` (Attributes) The scaling configuration of an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster.
 This property is only supported for Aurora Serverless v1. For Aurora Serverless v2, Use the ``ServerlessV2ScalingConfiguration`` property.
 Valid for: Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters only (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--scaling_configuration))
- `serverless_v2_scaling_configuration` (Attributes) The scaling configuration of an Aurora Serverless V2 DB cluster. 
 This property is only supported for Aurora Serverless v2. For Aurora Serverless v1, Use the ``ScalingConfiguration`` property.
 Valid for: Aurora Serverless v2 DB clusters only (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--serverless_v2_scaling_configuration))
- `snapshot_identifier` (String) The identifier for the DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot to restore from.
 You can use either the name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to specify a DB cluster snapshot. However, you can use only the ARN to specify a DB snapshot.
 After you restore a DB cluster with a ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property, you must specify the same ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property for any future updates to the DB cluster. When you specify this property for an update, the DB cluster is not restored from the snapshot again, and the data in the database is not changed. However, if you don't specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property, an empty DB cluster is created, and the original DB cluster is deleted. If you specify a property that is different from the previous snapshot restore property, a new DB cluster is restored from the specified ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property, and the original DB cluster is deleted.
 If you specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property to restore a DB cluster (as opposed to specifying it for DB cluster updates), then don't specify the following properties:
  +   ``GlobalClusterIdentifier`` 
  +   ``MasterUsername`` 
  +   ``MasterUserPassword`` 
  +   ``ReplicationSourceIdentifier`` 
  +   ``RestoreType`` 
  +   ``SourceDBClusterIdentifier`` 
  +   ``SourceRegion`` 
  +   ``StorageEncrypted`` (for an encrypted snapshot)

- `source_region` (String) The AWS Region which contains the source DB cluster when replicating a DB cluster. For example, ``us-east-1``. 
 Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only
- `storage_encrypted` (Boolean) Indicates whether the DB cluster is encrypted.
 If you specify the ``KmsKeyId`` property, then you must enable encryption.
 If you specify the ``SourceDBClusterIdentifier`` property, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the source DB cluster, and if the DB cluster is encrypted, the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is used.
 If you specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` and the specified snapshot is encrypted, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the snapshot, and the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is used.
 If you specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` and the specified snapshot isn't encrypted, you can use this property to specify that the restored DB cluster is encrypted. Specify the ``KmsKeyId`` property for the KMS key to use for encryption. If you don't want the restored DB cluster to be encrypted, then don't set this property or set it to ``false``.
  If you specify both the ``StorageEncrypted`` and ``SnapshotIdentifier`` properties without specifying the ``KmsKeyId`` property, then the restored DB cluster inherits the encryption settings from the DB snapshot that provide.
  Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
- `storage_throughput` (Number)
- `storage_type` (String) The storage type to associate with the DB cluster.

For information on storage types for Multi-AZ DB clusters, see [Settings for creating Multi-AZ DB clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/create-multi-az-db-cluster.html#create-multi-az-db-cluster-settings).
 This setting is required to create a Multi-AZ DB cluster.
 When specified for a Multi-AZ DB cluster, a value for the ``Iops`` parameter is required.
 Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
 Valid Values:
  +  Aurora DB clusters - ``aurora | aurora-iopt1`` 
  +  Multi-AZ DB clusters - ``io1 | io2 | gp3`` 
  
 Default:
  +  Aurora DB clusters - ``aurora`` 
  +  Multi-AZ DB clusters - ``io1`` 
  
  When you create an Aurora DB cluster with the storage type set to ``aurora-iopt1``, the storage type is returned in the response. The storage type isn't returned when you set it to ``aurora``.
- `tags` (Attributes Set) Tags to assign to the DB cluster.
 Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
- `use_latest_restorable_time` (Boolean) A value that indicates whether to restore the DB cluster to the latest restorable backup time. By default, the DB cluster is not restored to the latest restorable backup time. 
 Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
- `vpc_security_group_ids` (List of String) A list of EC2 VPC security groups to associate with this DB cluster.
 If you plan to update the resource, don't specify VPC security groups in a shared VPC.
 Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

### Nested Schema for `associated_roles`

Read-Only:

- `feature_name` (String) The name of the feature associated with the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role. IAM roles that are associated with a DB cluster grant permission for the DB cluster to access other AWS services on your behalf. For the list of supported feature names, see the ``SupportedFeatureNames`` description in [DBEngineVersion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DBEngineVersion.html) in the *Amazon RDS API Reference*.
- `role_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that is associated with the DB cluster.


<a id="nestedatt--endpoint"></a>
### Nested Schema for `endpoint`

Read-Only:

- `address` (String) Specifies the connection endpoint for the primary instance of the DB cluster.
- `port` (String) Specifies the port that the database engine is listening on.


<a id="nestedatt--master_user_secret"></a>
### Nested Schema for `master_user_secret`

Read-Only:

- `kms_key_id` (String) The AWS KMS key identifier that is used to encrypt the secret.
- `secret_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret. This parameter is a return value that you can retrieve using the ``Fn::GetAtt`` intrinsic function. For more information, see [Return values](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-rds-dbcluster.html#aws-resource-rds-dbcluster-return-values).


<a id="nestedatt--read_endpoint"></a>
### Nested Schema for `read_endpoint`

Read-Only:

- `address` (String) The host address of the reader endpoint.


<a id="nestedatt--scaling_configuration"></a>
### Nested Schema for `scaling_configuration`

Read-Only:

- `auto_pause` (Boolean) Indicates whether to allow or disallow automatic pause for an Aurora DB cluster in ``serverless`` DB engine mode. A DB cluster can be paused only when it's idle (it has no connections).
  If a DB cluster is paused for more than seven days, the DB cluster might be backed up with a snapshot. In this case, the DB cluster is restored when there is a request to connect to it.
- `max_capacity` (Number) The maximum capacity for an Aurora DB cluster in ``serverless`` DB engine mode.
 For Aurora MySQL, valid capacity values are ``1``, ``2``, ``4``, ``8``, ``16``, ``32``, ``64``, ``128``, and ``256``.
 For Aurora PostgreSQL, valid capacity values are ``2``, ``4``, ``8``, ``16``, ``32``, ``64``, ``192``, and ``384``.
 The maximum capacity must be greater than or equal to the minimum capacity.
- `min_capacity` (Number) The minimum capacity for an Aurora DB cluster in ``serverless`` DB engine mode.
 For Aurora MySQL, valid capacity values are ``1``, ``2``, ``4``, ``8``, ``16``, ``32``, ``64``, ``128``, and ``256``.
 For Aurora PostgreSQL, valid capacity values are ``2``, ``4``, ``8``, ``16``, ``32``, ``64``, ``192``, and ``384``.
 The minimum capacity must be less than or equal to the maximum capacity.
- `seconds_before_timeout` (Number) The amount of time, in seconds, that Aurora Serverless v1 tries to find a scaling point to perform seamless scaling before enforcing the timeout action. The default is 300.
 Specify a value between 60 and 600 seconds.
- `seconds_until_auto_pause` (Number) The time, in seconds, before an Aurora DB cluster in ``serverless`` mode is paused.
 Specify a value between 300 and 86,400 seconds.
- `timeout_action` (String) The action to take when the timeout is reached, either ``ForceApplyCapacityChange`` or ``RollbackCapacityChange``.
  ``ForceApplyCapacityChange`` sets the capacity to the specified value as soon as possible.
  ``RollbackCapacityChange``, the default, ignores the capacity change if a scaling point isn't found in the timeout period.
  If you specify ``ForceApplyCapacityChange``, connections that prevent Aurora Serverless v1 from finding a scaling point might be dropped.
  For more information, see [Autoscaling for Aurora Serverless v1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.how-it-works.html#aurora-serverless.how-it-works.auto-scaling) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.


<a id="nestedatt--serverless_v2_scaling_configuration"></a>
### Nested Schema for `serverless_v2_scaling_configuration`

Read-Only:

- `max_capacity` (Number) The maximum number of Aurora capacity units (ACUs) for a DB instance in an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster. You can specify ACU values in half-step increments, such as 40, 40.5, 41, and so on. The largest value that you can use is 128.
 The maximum capacity must be higher than 0.5 ACUs. For more information, see [Choosing the maximum Aurora Serverless v2 capacity setting for a cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v2.setting-capacity.html#aurora-serverless-v2.max_capacity_considerations) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.
 Aurora automatically sets certain parameters for Aurora Serverless V2 DB instances to values that depend on the maximum ACU value in the capacity range. When you update the maximum capacity value, the ``ParameterApplyStatus`` value for the DB instance changes to ``pending-reboot``. You can update the parameter values by rebooting the DB instance after changing the capacity range.
- `min_capacity` (Number) The minimum number of Aurora capacity units (ACUs) for a DB instance in an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster. You can specify ACU values in half-step increments, such as 8, 8.5, 9, and so on. For Aurora versions that support the Aurora Serverless v2 auto-pause feature, the smallest value that you can use is 0. For versions that don't support Aurora Serverless v2 auto-pause, the smallest value that you can use is 0.5.
- `seconds_until_auto_pause` (Number)
