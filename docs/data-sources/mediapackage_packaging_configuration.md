Data Source schema for AWS::MediaPackage::PackagingConfiguration



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- **id** (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- **arn** (String) The ARN of the PackagingConfiguration.
- **cmaf_package** (Attributes) A CMAF packaging configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cmaf_package))
- **dash_package** (Attributes) A Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) packaging configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--dash_package))
- **hls_package** (Attributes) An HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) packaging configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--hls_package))
- **mss_package** (Attributes) A Microsoft Smooth Streaming (MSS) PackagingConfiguration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--mss_package))
- **packaging_group_id** (String) The ID of a PackagingGroup.
- **tags** (Attributes List) A collection of tags associated with a resource (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))

### Nested Schema for `cmaf_package`

Read-Only:

- **encryption** (Attributes) A CMAF encryption configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cmaf_package--encryption))
- **hls_manifests** (Attributes List) A list of HLS manifest configurations. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cmaf_package--hls_manifests))
- **include_encoder_configuration_in_segments** (Boolean) When includeEncoderConfigurationInSegments is set to true, MediaPackage places your encoder's Sequence Parameter Set (SPS), Picture Parameter Set (PPS), and Video Parameter Set (VPS) metadata in every video segment instead of in the init fragment. This lets you use different SPS/PPS/VPS settings for your assets during content playback.
- **segment_duration_seconds** (Number) Duration (in seconds) of each fragment. Actual fragments will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the source fragment duration.

<a id="nestedatt--cmaf_package--encryption"></a>
### Nested Schema for `cmaf_package.encryption`

- **speke_key_provider** (Attributes) A configuration for accessing an external Secure Packager and Encoder Key Exchange (SPEKE) service that will provide encryption keys. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cmaf_package--encryption--speke_key_provider))

<a id="nestedatt--cmaf_package--encryption--speke_key_provider"></a>
### Nested Schema for `cmaf_package.encryption.speke_key_provider`

Read-Only:

- **role_arn** (String) An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that AWS Elemental MediaPackage will assume when accessing the key provider service.

<a id="nestedatt--cmaf_package--hls_manifests"></a>
### Nested Schema for `cmaf_package.hls_manifests`

Read-Only:

- **ad_markers** (String) This setting controls how ad markers are included in the packaged OriginEndpoint. "NONE" will omit all SCTE-35 ad markers from the output. "PASSTHROUGH" causes the manifest to contain a copy of the SCTE-35 ad markers (comments) taken directly from the input HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest. "SCTE35_ENHANCED" generates ad markers and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the input source.
- **include_iframe_only_stream** (Boolean) When enabled, an I-Frame only stream will be included in the output.
- **manifest_name** (String) An optional string to include in the name of the manifest.
- **program_date_time_interval_seconds** (Number) The interval (in seconds) between each EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tag inserted into manifests. Additionally, when an interval is specified ID3Timed Metadata messages will be generated every 5 seconds using the ingest time of the content. If the interval is not specified, or set to 0, then no EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags will be inserted into manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata messages will be generated. Note that irrespective of this parameter, if any ID3 Timed Metadata is found in HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) input, it will be passed through to HLS output.
- **repeat_ext_x_key** (Boolean) When enabled, the EXT-X-KEY tag will be repeated in output manifests.
- **stream_selection** (Attributes) A StreamSelection configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cmaf_package--hls_manifests--stream_selection))

- **include_encoder_configuration_in_segments** (Boolean) When includeEncoderConfigurationInSegments is set to true, MediaPackage places your encoder's Sequence Parameter Set (SPS), Picture Parameter Set (PPS), and Video Parameter Set (VPS) metadata in every video segment instead of in the init fragment. This lets you use different SPS/PPS/VPS settings for your assets during content playback.
- **period_triggers** (List of String) A list of triggers that controls when the outgoing Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) Media Presentation Description (MPD) will be partitioned into multiple periods. If empty, the content will not be partitioned into more than one period. If the list contains "ADS", new periods will be created where the Asset contains SCTE-35 ad markers.
- **segment_duration_seconds** (Number) Duration (in seconds) of each fragment. Actual fragments will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the source fragment duration.
- **segment_template_format** (String) Determines the type of SegmentTemplate included in the Media Presentation Description (MPD). When set to NUMBER_WITH_TIMELINE, a full timeline is presented in each SegmentTemplate, with $Number$ media URLs. When set to TIME_WITH_TIMELINE, a full timeline is presented in each SegmentTemplate, with $Time$ media URLs. When set to NUMBER_WITH_DURATION, only a duration is included in each SegmentTemplate, with $Number$ media URLs.
