Data Source schema for AWS::SageMaker::Cluster



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `cluster_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the HyperPod Cluster.
- `cluster_name` (String) The name of the HyperPod Cluster.
- `cluster_status` (String) The status of the HyperPod Cluster.
- `creation_time` (String) The time at which the HyperPod cluster was created.
- `failure_message` (String) The failure message of the HyperPod Cluster.
- `instance_groups` (Attributes List) The instance groups of the SageMaker HyperPod cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--instance_groups))
- `node_recovery` (String) If node auto-recovery is set to true, faulty nodes will be replaced or rebooted when a failure is detected. If set to false, nodes will be labelled when a fault is detected.
- `orchestrator` (Attributes) Specifies parameter(s) specific to the orchestrator, e.g. specify the EKS cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--orchestrator))
- `tags` (Attributes Set) Custom tags for managing the SageMaker HyperPod cluster as an AWS resource. You can add tags to your cluster in the same way you add them in other AWS services that support tagging. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
- `vpc_config` (Attributes) Specifies an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that your SageMaker jobs, hosted models, and compute resources have access to. You can control access to and from your resources by configuring a VPC. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--vpc_config))

### Nested Schema for `instance_groups`

Read-Only:

- `current_count` (Number) The number of instances that are currently in the instance group of a SageMaker HyperPod cluster.
- `execution_role` (String) The execution role for the instance group to assume.
- `instance_count` (Number) The number of instances you specified to add to the instance group of a SageMaker HyperPod cluster.
- `instance_group_name` (String) The name of the instance group of a SageMaker HyperPod cluster.
- `instance_storage_configs` (Attributes List) The instance storage configuration for the instance group. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--instance_groups--instance_storage_configs))
- `instance_type` (String) The instance type of the instance group of a SageMaker HyperPod cluster.
- `life_cycle_config` (Attributes) The lifecycle configuration for a SageMaker HyperPod cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--instance_groups--life_cycle_config))
- `on_start_deep_health_checks` (List of String) Nodes will undergo advanced stress test to detect and replace faulty instances, based on the type of deep health check(s) passed in.
- `override_vpc_config` (Attributes) Specifies an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that your SageMaker jobs, hosted models, and compute resources have access to. You can control access to and from your resources by configuring a VPC. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--instance_groups--override_vpc_config))
- `threads_per_core` (Number) The number you specified to TreadsPerCore in CreateCluster for enabling or disabling multithreading. For instance types that support multithreading, you can specify 1 for disabling multithreading and 2 for enabling multithreading.

### Nested Schema for `instance_groups.instance_storage_configs`

Read-Only:

- `ebs_volume_config` (Attributes) Defines the configuration for attaching additional Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes to the instances in the SageMaker HyperPod cluster instance group. The additional EBS volume is attached to each instance within the SageMaker HyperPod cluster instance group and mounted to /opt/sagemaker. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--instance_groups--instance_storage_configs--ebs_volume_config))
