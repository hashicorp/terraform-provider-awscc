## Schema

- `cluster_identifier` (String) A unique identifier for the cluster. You use this identifier to refer to the cluster for any subsequent cluster operations such as deleting or modifying.

- `encrypted` (Boolean) If true, the data in the cluster is encrypted at rest.
- `endpoint` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--endpoint))
- `enhanced_vpc_routing` (Boolean) An option that specifies whether to create the cluster with enhanced VPC routing enabled. To create a cluster that uses enhanced VPC routing, the cluster must be in a VPC. For more information, see Enhanced VPC Routing in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.

If this option is true , enhanced VPC routing is enabled.

Default: false
- `hsm_client_certificate_identifier` (String) Specifies the name of the HSM client certificate the Amazon Redshift cluster uses to retrieve the data encryption keys stored in an HSM
- `hsm_configuration_identifier` (String) Specifies the name of the HSM configuration that contains the information the Amazon Redshift cluster can use to retrieve and store keys in an HSM.
- `iam_roles` (List of String) A list of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles that can be used by the cluster to access other AWS services. You must supply the IAM roles in their Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format. You can supply up to 50 IAM roles in a single request
- `kms_key_id` (String) The AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key ID of the encryption key that you want to use to encrypt data in the cluster.
- `logging_properties` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--logging_properties))
- `maintenance_track_name` (String) The name for the maintenance track that you want to assign for the cluster. This name change is asynchronous. The new track name stays in the PendingModifiedValues for the cluster until the next maintenance window. When the maintenance track changes, the cluster is switched to the latest cluster release available for the maintenance track. At this point, the maintenance track name is applied.
- `manage_master_password` (Boolean) A boolean indicating if the redshift cluster's admin user credentials is managed by Redshift or not. You can't use MasterUserPassword if ManageMasterPassword is true. If ManageMasterPassword is false or not set, Amazon Redshift uses MasterUserPassword for the admin user account's password.
