<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `arn` (String)
- `bypass_policy_lockout_safety_check` (Boolean) Skips ("bypasses") the key policy lockout safety check. The default value is false.
- `description` (String) A description of the AWS KMS key. Use a description that helps you to distinguish this AWS KMS key from others in the account, such as its intended use.
- `enable_key_rotation` (Boolean) Enables automatic rotation of the key material for the specified AWS KMS key. By default, automation key rotation is not enabled.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Specifies whether the AWS KMS key is enabled. Disabled AWS KMS keys cannot be used in cryptographic operations.
- `key_id` (String)
- `key_policy` (String) The key policy that authorizes use of the AWS KMS key. The key policy must observe the following rules.
- `key_spec` (String) Specifies the type of AWS KMS key to create. The default value is SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT. This property is required only for asymmetric AWS KMS keys. You can't change the KeySpec value after the AWS KMS key is created.
- `key_usage` (String) Determines the cryptographic operations for which you can use the AWS KMS key. The default value is ENCRYPT_DECRYPT. This property is required only for asymmetric AWS KMS keys. You can't change the KeyUsage value after the AWS KMS key is created.
- `multi_region` (Boolean) Specifies whether the AWS KMS key should be Multi-Region. You can't change the MultiRegion value after the AWS KMS key is created.
- `origin` (String) The source of the key material for the KMS key. You cannot change the origin after you create the KMS key. The default is AWS_KMS, which means that AWS KMS creates the key material.
- `pending_window_in_days` (Number) Specifies the number of days in the waiting period before AWS KMS deletes an AWS KMS key that has been removed from a CloudFormation stack. Enter a value between 7 and 30 days. The default value is 30 days.
- `tags` (Attributes Set) An array of key-value pairs to apply to this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
