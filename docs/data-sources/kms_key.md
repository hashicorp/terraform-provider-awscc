## Schema

### Required

- **id** (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- **arn** (String)
- **description** (String) A description of the CMK. Use a description that helps you to distinguish this CMK from others in the account, such as its intended use.
- **enable_key_rotation** (Boolean) Enables automatic rotation of the key material for the specified customer master key (CMK). By default, automation key rotation is not enabled.
- **enabled** (Boolean) Specifies whether the customer master key (CMK) is enabled. Disabled CMKs cannot be used in cryptographic operations.
- **key_id** (String)
- **key_policy** (String) The key policy that authorizes use of the CMK. The key policy must observe the following rules.
- **key_spec** (String) Specifies the type of CMK to create. The default value is SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT. This property is required only for asymmetric CMKs. You can't change the KeySpec value after the CMK is created.
- **key_usage** (String) Determines the cryptographic operations for which you can use the CMK. The default value is ENCRYPT_DECRYPT. This property is required only for asymmetric CMKs. You can't change the KeyUsage value after the CMK is created.
- **multi_region** (Boolean) Specifies whether the CMK should be Multi-Region. You can't change the MultiRegion value after the CMK is created.
- **pending_window_in_days** (Number) Specifies the number of days in the waiting period before AWS KMS deletes a CMK that has been removed from a CloudFormation stack. Enter a value between 7 and 30 days. The default value is 30 days.
- **tags** (Attributes Set) An array of key-value pairs to apply to this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
