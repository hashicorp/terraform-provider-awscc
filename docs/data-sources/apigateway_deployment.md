Data Source schema for AWS::ApiGateway::Deployment



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `deployment_canary_settings` (Attributes) Specifies settings for the canary deployment. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--deployment_canary_settings))
- `deployment_id` (String) Primary Id for this resource
- `description` (String) A description of the purpose of the API Gateway deployment.
- `rest_api_id` (String) The ID of the RestApi resource to deploy.
- `stage_description` (Attributes) Configures the stage that API Gateway creates with this deployment. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--stage_description))
- `stage_name` (String) A name for the stage that API Gateway creates with this deployment. Use only alphanumeric characters.

<a id="nestedatt--deployment_canary_settings"></a>
### Nested Schema for `deployment_canary_settings`

Read-Only:

- `percent_traffic` (Number) The percentage (0-100) of traffic diverted to a canary deployment.
- `stage_variable_overrides` (Map of String) Stage variables overridden for a canary release deployment, including new stage variables introduced in the canary. These stage variables are represented as a string-to-string map between stage variable names and their values. Duplicates are not allowed.
- `use_stage_cache` (Boolean) Whether the canary deployment uses the stage cache.


<a id="nestedatt--stage_description"></a>
### Nested Schema for `stage_description`

Read-Only:

- `access_log_setting` (Attributes) Specifies settings for logging access in this stage. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--stage_description--access_log_setting))
- `cache_cluster_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether cache clustering is enabled for the stage.
- `cache_cluster_size` (String) The size of the stage's cache cluster.
- `cache_data_encrypted` (Boolean) The time-to-live (TTL) period, in seconds, that specifies how long API Gateway caches responses.
- `cache_ttl_in_seconds` (Number) The time-to-live (TTL) period, in seconds, that specifies how long API Gateway caches responses.
- `caching_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether responses are cached and returned for requests. You must enable a cache cluster on the stage to cache responses.
- `canary_setting` (Attributes) Specifies settings for the canary deployment in this stage. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--stage_description--canary_setting))
- `client_certificate_id` (String) The identifier of the client certificate that API Gateway uses to call your integration endpoints in the stage.
- `data_trace_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether data trace logging is enabled for methods in the stage. API Gateway pushes these logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
- `description` (String) A description of the purpose of the stage.
- `documentation_version` (String) The version identifier of the API documentation snapshot.
- `logging_level` (String) The logging level for this method. For valid values, see the loggingLevel property of the Stage resource in the Amazon API Gateway API Reference.
- `method_settings` (Attributes Set) Configures settings for all of the stage's methods. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--stage_description--method_settings))
- `metrics_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether Amazon CloudWatch metrics are enabled for methods in the stage.
- `tags` (Attributes List) An array of arbitrary tags (key-value pairs) to associate with the stage. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--stage_description--tags))
- `throttling_burst_limit` (Number) The number of burst requests per second that API Gateway permits across all APIs, stages, and methods in your AWS account.
- `throttling_rate_limit` (Number) The number of steady-state requests per second that API Gateway permits across all APIs, stages, and methods in your AWS account.
- `tracing_enabled` (Boolean) Specifies whether active tracing with X-ray is enabled for this stage.
- `variables` (Map of String) A map that defines the stage variables. Variable names must consist of alphanumeric characters, and the values must match the following regular expression: [A-Za-z0-9-._~:/?#&=,]+.

### Nested Schema for `stage_description.access_log_setting`

Read-Only:

- `destination_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CloudWatch Logs log group or Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to receive access logs. If you specify a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream, the stream name must begin with amazon-apigateway-.
- `format` (String) A single line format of the access logs of data, as specified by selected $context variables. The format must include at least $context.requestId.
