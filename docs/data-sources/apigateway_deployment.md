<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- **id** (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- **deployment_canary_settings** (Attributes) Specifies settings for the canary deployment. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--deployment_canary_settings))
- **deployment_id** (String) Primary Id for this resource
- **description** (String) A description of the purpose of the API Gateway deployment.
- **rest_api_id** (String) The ID of the RestApi resource to deploy.
- **stage_description** (Attributes) Configures the stage that API Gateway creates with this deployment. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--stage_description))
- **stage_name** (String) A name for the stage that API Gateway creates with this deployment. Use only alphanumeric characters.

<a id="nestedatt--deployment_canary_settings"></a>
### Nested Schema for `deployment_canary_settings`

Read-Only:

- **percent_traffic** (Number) The percentage (0-100) of traffic diverted to a canary deployment.
- **stage_variable_overrides** (Map of String) Stage variables overridden for a canary release deployment, including new stage variables introduced in the canary. These stage variables are represented as a string-to-string map between stage variable names and their values. Duplicates are not allowed.
- **use_stage_cache** (Boolean) Whether the canary deployment uses the stage cache.


<a id="nestedatt--stage_description"></a>
### Nested Schema for `stage_description`

Read-Only:

- **access_log_setting** (Attributes) Specifies settings for logging access in this stage. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--stage_description--access_log_setting))
- **cache_cluster_enabled** (Boolean) Indicates whether cache clustering is enabled for the stage.
- **cache_cluster_size** (String) The size of the stage's cache cluster.
- **cache_data_encrypted** (Boolean) The time-to-live (TTL) period, in seconds, that specifies how long API Gateway caches responses.
- **cache_ttl_in_seconds** (Number) The time-to-live (TTL) period, in seconds, that specifies how long API Gateway caches responses.
- **caching_enabled** (Boolean) Indicates whether responses are cached and returned for requests. You must enable a cache cluster on the stage to cache responses.
- **canary_setting** (Attributes) Specifies settings for the canary deployment in this stage. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--stage_description--canary_setting))
- **client_certificate_id** (String) The identifier of the client certificate that API Gateway uses to call your integration endpoints in the stage.
- **data_trace_enabled** (Boolean) Indicates whether data trace logging is enabled for methods in the stage. API Gateway pushes these logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
- **description** (String) A description of the purpose of the stage.
- **documentation_version** (String) The version identifier of the API documentation snapshot.
- **logging_level** (String) The logging level for this method. For valid values, see the loggingLevel property of the Stage resource in the Amazon API Gateway API Reference.
- **method_settings** (Attributes Set) Configures settings for all of the stage's methods. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--stage_description--method_settings))
- **metrics_enabled** (Boolean) Indicates whether Amazon CloudWatch metrics are enabled for methods in the stage.
- **tags** (Attributes List) An array of arbitrary tags (key-value pairs) to associate with the stage. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--stage_description--tags))
- **throttling_burst_limit** (Number) The number of burst requests per second that API Gateway permits across all APIs, stages, and methods in your AWS account.
- **throttling_rate_limit** (Number) The number of steady-state requests per second that API Gateway permits across all APIs, stages, and methods in your AWS account.
- **tracing_enabled** (Boolean) Specifies whether active tracing with X-ray is enabled for this stage.
- **variables** (Map of String) A map that defines the stage variables. Variable names must consist of alphanumeric characters, and the values must match the following regular expression: [A-Za-z0-9-._~:/?#&=,]+.

Read-Only:

- **destination_arn** (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CloudWatch Logs log group or Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to receive access logs. If you specify a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream, the stream name must begin with amazon-apigateway-.
- **format** (String) A single line format of the access logs of data, as specified by selected $context variables. The format must include at least $context.requestId.
