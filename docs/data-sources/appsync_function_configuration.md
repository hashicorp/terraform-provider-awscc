Data Source schema for AWS::AppSync::FunctionConfiguration



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `api_id` (String) The AWS AppSync GraphQL API that you want to attach using this function.
- `code` (String) The resolver code that contains the request and response functions. When code is used, the runtime is required. The runtime value must be APPSYNC_JS.
- `code_s3_location` (String) The Amazon S3 endpoint (where the code is located??).
- `data_source_name` (String) The name of data source this function will attach.
- `description` (String) The function description.
- `function_arn` (String) The ARN for the function generated by the service
- `function_id` (String) The unique identifier for the function generated by the service
- `function_version` (String) The version of the request mapping template. Currently, only the 2018-05-29 version of the template is supported.
- `max_batch_size` (Number) The maximum number of resolver request inputs that will be sent to a single AWS Lambda function in a BatchInvoke operation.
- `name` (String) The name of the function.
- `request_mapping_template` (String) The Function request mapping template. Functions support only the 2018-05-29 version of the request mapping template.
- `request_mapping_template_s3_location` (String) Describes a Sync configuration for a resolver. Contains information on which Conflict Detection, as well as Resolution strategy, should be performed when the resolver is invoked.
- `response_mapping_template` (String) The Function response mapping template.
- `response_mapping_template_s3_location` (String) The location of a response mapping template in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use this if you want to provision with a template file in Amazon S3 rather than embedding it in your CloudFormation template.
- `runtime` (Attributes) Describes a runtime used by an AWS AppSync pipeline resolver or AWS AppSync function. Specifies the name and version of the runtime to use. Note that if a runtime is specified, code must also be specified. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--runtime))
- `sync_config` (Attributes) Describes a Sync configuration for a resolver. Specifies which Conflict Detection strategy and Resolution strategy to use when the resolver is invoked. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sync_config))
