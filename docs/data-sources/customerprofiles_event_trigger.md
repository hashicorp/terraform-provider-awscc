<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The timestamp of when the event trigger was created.
- `description` (String) The description of the event trigger.
- `domain_name` (String) The unique name of the domain.
- `event_trigger_conditions` (Attributes List) A list of conditions that determine when an event should trigger the destination. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--event_trigger_conditions))
- `event_trigger_limits` (Attributes) Defines limits controlling whether an event triggers the destination, based on ingestion latency and the number of invocations per profile over specific time periods. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--event_trigger_limits))
- `event_trigger_name` (String) The unique name of the event trigger.
- `last_updated_at` (String) The timestamp of when the event trigger was most recently updated.
- `object_type_name` (String) The unique name of the object type.
- `segment_filter` (String) The destination is triggered only for profiles that meet the criteria of a segment definition.
- `tags` (Attributes Set) An array of key-value pairs to apply to this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))

<a id="nestedatt--event_trigger_limits"></a>
### Nested Schema for `event_trigger_limits`

Read-Only:

- `event_expiration` (Number) Specifies that an event will only trigger the destination if it is processed within a certain latency period.
- `periods` (Attributes List) A list of time periods during which the limits apply. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--event_trigger_limits--periods))

<a id="nestedatt--event_trigger_limits--periods"></a>
### Nested Schema for `event_trigger_limits.periods`

Read-Only:

- `max_invocations_per_profile` (Number) The maximum allowed number of destination invocations per profile.
- `unit` (String) The unit of time.
- `unlimited` (Boolean) If set to true, there is no limit on the number of destination invocations per profile. The default is false.
- `value` (Number) The amount of time of the specified unit.



<a id="nestedatt--tags"></a>
### Nested Schema for `tags`

Read-Only:

- `key` (String) The key name of the tag. You can specify a value that is 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length and cannot be prefixed with aws:. You can use any of the following characters: the set of Unicode letters, digits, whitespace, _, ., /, =, +, and -.
