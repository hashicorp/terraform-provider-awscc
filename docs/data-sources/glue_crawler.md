# awscc_glue_crawler (Data Source)

Data Source schema for AWS::Glue::Crawler



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `classifiers` (List of String) A list of UTF-8 strings that specify the names of custom classifiers that are associated with the crawler.
- `configuration` (String) Crawler configuration information. This versioned JSON string allows users to specify aspects of a crawler's behavior.
- `crawler_security_configuration` (String) The name of the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used by this crawler.
- `database_name` (String) The name of the database in which the crawler's output is stored.
- `description` (String) A description of the crawler.
- `lake_formation_configuration` (Attributes) Specifies AWS Lake Formation configuration settings for the crawler (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--lake_formation_configuration))
- `name` (String) The name of the crawler.
- `recrawl_policy` (Attributes) When crawling an Amazon S3 data source after the first crawl is complete, specifies whether to crawl the entire dataset again or to crawl only folders that were added since the last crawler run. For more information, see Incremental Crawls in AWS Glue in the developer guide. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--recrawl_policy))
- `role` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that's used to access customer resources, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) data.
- `schedule` (Attributes) A scheduling object using a cron statement to schedule an event. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--schedule))
- `schema_change_policy` (Attributes) The policy that specifies update and delete behaviors for the crawler. The policy tells the crawler what to do in the event that it detects a change in a table that already exists in the customer's database at the time of the crawl. The SchemaChangePolicy does not affect whether or how new tables and partitions are added. New tables and partitions are always created regardless of the SchemaChangePolicy on a crawler. The SchemaChangePolicy consists of two components, UpdateBehavior and DeleteBehavior. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--schema_change_policy))
- `table_prefix` (String) The prefix added to the names of tables that are created.
- `tags` (String) The tags to use with this crawler.
- `targets` (Attributes) Specifies data stores to crawl. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--targets))

A value of CRAWL_EVERYTHING specifies crawling the entire dataset again. A value of CRAWL_NEW_FOLDERS_ONLY specifies crawling only folders that were added since the last crawler run. A value of CRAWL_EVENT_MODE specifies crawling only the changes identified by Amazon S3 events.


<a id="nestedatt--schedule"></a>
### Nested Schema for `schedule`

Read-Only:

- `schedule_expression` (String) A cron expression used to specify the schedule. For more information, see Time-Based Schedules for Jobs and Crawlers. For example, to run something every day at 12:15 UTC, specify cron(15 12 * * ? *).


<a id="nestedatt--schema_change_policy"></a>
### Nested Schema for `schema_change_policy`

Read-Only:

A value of DELETE_FROM_DATABASE specifies that if a table or partition is found to have been removed, delete it from the database. A value of DEPRECATE_IN_DATABASE specifies that if a table has been found to no longer exist, to add a property to the table that says 'DEPRECATED' and includes a timestamp with the time of deprecation.
- `update_behavior` (String) The update behavior when the crawler finds a changed schema. A value of LOG specifies that if a table or a partition already exists, and a change is detected, do not update it, only log that a change was detected. Add new tables and new partitions (including on existing tables). A value of UPDATE_IN_DATABASE specifies that if a table or partition already exists, and a change is detected, update it. Add new tables and partitions.
