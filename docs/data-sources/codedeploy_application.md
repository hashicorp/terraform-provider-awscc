## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

- `compute_platform` (String) The compute platform that CodeDeploy deploys the application to.
- `tags` (Attributes List) The metadata that you apply to CodeDeploy applications to help you organize and categorize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
