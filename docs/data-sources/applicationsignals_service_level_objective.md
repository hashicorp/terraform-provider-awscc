<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `arn` (String) The ARN of this SLO.
- `burn_rate_configurations` (Attributes Set) Each object in this array defines the length of the look-back window used to calculate one burn rate metric for this SLO.

- `evaluation_type` (String) Displays whether this is a period-based SLO or a request-based SLO.
- `exclusion_windows` (Attributes Set) Each object in this array defines a time exclusion window for this SLO. The time exclusion window is used to exclude breaching data points from affecting attainment rate, error budget, and burn rate metrics. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--exclusion_windows))
- `goal` (Attributes) A structure that contains the attributes that determine the goal of the SLO. This includes the time period for evaluation and the attainment threshold. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--goal))
- `last_updated_time` (Number) Epoch time in seconds of the time that this SLO was most recently updated
- `name` (String) The name of this SLO.
- `request_based_sli` (Attributes) This structure contains information about the performance metric that a request-based SLO monitors. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--request_based_sli))
- `sli` (Attributes) This structure contains information about the performance metric that an SLO monitors. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sli))
- `tags` (Attributes Set) The list of tag keys and values associated with the resource you specified (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))

If you omit this parameter, 99 is used to represent 99% as the attainment goal.
