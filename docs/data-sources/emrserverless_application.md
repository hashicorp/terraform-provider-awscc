<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `application_id` (String) The ID of the EMR Serverless Application.
- `architecture` (String) The cpu architecture of an application.
- `arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the EMR Serverless Application.
- `auto_start_configuration` (Attributes) Configuration for Auto Start of Application. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--auto_start_configuration))
- `auto_stop_configuration` (Attributes) Configuration for Auto Stop of Application. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--auto_stop_configuration))
- `image_configuration` (Attributes) The image configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--image_configuration))
- `initial_capacity` (Attributes Set) Initial capacity initialized when an Application is started. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--initial_capacity))
- `maximum_capacity` (Attributes) Maximum allowed cumulative resources for an Application. No new resources will be created once the limit is hit. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--maximum_capacity))
- `name` (String) User friendly Application name.
- `network_configuration` (Attributes) Network Configuration for customer VPC connectivity. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--network_configuration))
- `release_label` (String) EMR release label.
- `tags` (Attributes Set) Tag map with key and value (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
- `type` (String) The type of the application
- `worker_type_specifications` (Attributes Map) The key-value pairs that specify worker type to WorkerTypeSpecificationInput. This parameter must contain all valid worker types for a Spark or Hive application. Valid worker types include Driver and Executor for Spark applications and HiveDriver and TezTask for Hive applications. You can either set image details in this parameter for each worker type, or in imageConfiguration for all worker types. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--worker_type_specifications))
