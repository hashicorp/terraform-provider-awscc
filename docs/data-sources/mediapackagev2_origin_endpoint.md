### Nested Schema for `segment.encryption`

Read-Only:

- `cmaf_exclude_segment_drm_metadata` (Boolean) <p>Excludes SEIG and SGPD boxes from segment metadata in CMAF containers.</p> <p>When set to <code>true</code>, MediaPackage omits these DRM metadata boxes from CMAF segments, which can improve compatibility with certain devices and players that don't support these boxes.</p> <p>Important considerations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>This setting only affects CMAF container formats</p> </li> <li> <p>Key rotation can still be handled through media playlist signaling</p> </li> <li> <p>PSSH and TENC boxes remain unaffected</p> </li> <li> <p>Default behavior is preserved when this setting is disabled</p> </li> </ul> <p>Valid values: <code>true</code> | <code>false</code> </p> <p>Default: <code>false</code> </p>

The service retrieves content keys before the live content begins streaming, and then retrieves them as needed over the lifetime of the workflow. By default, key rotation is set to 300 seconds (5 minutes), the minimum rotation interval, which is equivalent to setting it to 300. If you don't enter an interval, content keys aren't rotated.</p> <p>The following example setting causes the service to rotate keys every thirty minutes: <code>1800</code> </p>

- `role_arn` (String) <p>The ARN for the IAM role granted by the key provider that provides access to the key provider API. This role must have a trust policy that allows MediaPackage to assume the role, and it must have a sufficient permissions policy to allow access to the specific key retrieval URL. Get this from your DRM solution provider.</p> <p>Valid format: <code>arn:aws:iam::{accountID}:role/{name}</code>. The following example shows a role ARN: <code>arn:aws:iam::444455556666:role/SpekeAccess</code> </p>
