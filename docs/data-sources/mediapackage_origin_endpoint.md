"SCTE35_ENHANCED" generates ad markers and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the input source. "DATERANGE" inserts EXT-X-DATERANGE tags to signal ad and program transition events in HLS and CMAF manifests. For this option, you must set a programDateTimeIntervalSeconds value that is greater than 0.

Choosing "NONE" means no SCTE-35 messages become ads.  Choosing "RESTRICTED" means SCTE-35 messages of the types specified in AdTriggers that contain delivery restrictions will be treated as ads.  Choosing "UNRESTRICTED" means SCTE-35 messages of the types specified in AdTriggers that do not contain delivery restrictions will be treated as ads.  Choosing "BOTH" means all SCTE-35 messages of the types specified in AdTriggers will be treated as ads.  Note that Splice Insert messages do not have these flags and are always treated as ads if specified in AdTriggers.
- **id** (String) The ID of the manifest. The ID must be unique within the OriginEndpoint and it cannot be changed after it is created.
- **include_iframe_only_stream** (Boolean) When enabled, an I-Frame only stream will be included in the output.
- **manifest_name** (String) An optional short string appended to the end of the OriginEndpoint URL. If not specified, defaults to the manifestName for the OriginEndpoint.

If the interval is not specified, or set to 0, then no EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags will be inserted into manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata messages will be generated. Note that irrespective of this parameter, if any ID3 Timed Metadata is found in HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) input, it will be passed through to HLS output.
