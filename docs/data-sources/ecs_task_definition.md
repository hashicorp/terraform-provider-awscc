Data Source schema for AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `container_definitions` (Attributes Set) A list of container definitions in JSON format that describe the different containers that make up your task. For more information about container definition parameters and defaults, see [Amazon ECS Task Definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_defintions.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--container_definitions))
- `cpu` (String) The number of ``cpu`` units used by the task. If you use the EC2 launch type, this field is optional. Any value can be used. If you use the Fargate launch type, this field is required. You must use one of the following values. The value that you choose determines your range of valid values for the ``memory`` parameter.
 The CPU units cannot be less than 1 vCPU when you use Windows containers on Fargate.
  +  256 (.25 vCPU) - Available ``memory`` values: 512 (0.5 GB), 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB)
  +  512 (.5 vCPU) - Available ``memory`` values: 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB)
  +  1024 (1 vCPU) - Available ``memory`` values: 2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB), 5120 (5 GB), 6144 (6 GB), 7168 (7 GB), 8192 (8 GB)
  +  2048 (2 vCPU) - Available ``memory`` values: 4096 (4 GB) and 16384 (16 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB)
  +  4096 (4 vCPU) - Available ``memory`` values: 8192 (8 GB) and 30720 (30 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB)
  +  8192 (8 vCPU) - Available ``memory`` va
- `ephemeral_storage` (Attributes) The ephemeral storage settings to use for tasks run with the task definition. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--ephemeral_storage))
- `execution_role_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution role that grants the Amazon ECS container agent permission to make AWS API calls on your behalf. The task execution IAM role is required depending on the requirements of your task. For more information, see [Amazon ECS task execution IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_execution_IAM_role.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
- `family` (String) The name of a family that this task definition is registered to. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.
 A family groups multiple versions of a task definition. Amazon ECS gives the first task definition that you registered to a family a revision number of 1. Amazon ECS gives sequential revision numbers to each task definition that you add.
  To use revision numbers when you update a task definition, specify this property. If you don't specify a value, CFNlong generates a new task definition each time that you update it.
- `inference_accelerators` (Attributes Set) The Elastic Inference accelerators to use for the containers in the task. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--inference_accelerators))
- `ipc_mode` (String) The IPC resource namespace to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are ``host``, ``task``, or ``none``. If ``host`` is specified, then all containers within the tasks that specified the ``host`` IPC mode on the same container instance share the same IPC resources with the host Amazon EC2 instance. If ``task`` is specified, all containers within the specified task share the same IPC resources. If ``none`` is specified, then IPC resources within the containers of a task are private and not shared with other containers in a task or on the container instance. If no value is specified, then the IPC resource namespace sharing depends on the Docker daemon setting on the container instance. For more information, see [IPC settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#ipc-settings---ipc) in the *Docker run reference*.
 If the ``host`` IPC mode is used, be aware that there is a heightened risk of undesired IPC namespace expose. For more inform
- `memory` (String) The amount (in MiB) of memory used by the task.
 If your tasks runs on Amazon EC2 instances, you must specify either a task-level memory value or a container-level memory value. This field is optional and any value can be used. If a task-level memory value is specified, the container-level memory value is optional. For more information regarding container-level memory and memory reservation, see [ContainerDefinition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ContainerDefinition.html).
 If your tasks runs on FARGATElong, this field is required. You must use one of the following values. The value you choose determines your range of valid values for the ``cpu`` parameter.
  +  512 (0.5 GB), 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB) - Available ``cpu`` values: 256 (.25 vCPU)
  +  1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB) - Available ``cpu`` values: 512 (.5 vCPU)
  +  2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB), 5120 (5 GB), 6144 (6 GB), 7168 (7 GB), 8192 (8 GB) - Available ``cpu`` va
- `network_mode` (String) The Docker networking mode to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are ``none``, ``bridge``, ``awsvpc``, and ``host``. If no network mode is specified, the default is ``bridge``.
 For Amazon ECS tasks on Fargate, the ``awsvpc`` network mode is required. For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Linux instances, any network mode can be used. For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Windows instances, ``<default>`` or ``awsvpc`` can be used. If the network mode is set to ``none``, you cannot specify port mappings in your container definitions, and the tasks containers do not have external connectivity. The ``host`` and ``awsvpc`` network modes offer the highest networking performance for containers because they use the EC2 network stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided by the ``bridge`` mode.
 With the ``host`` and ``awsvpc`` network modes, exposed container ports are mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the ``host`` network mode) or the attached elasti
- `pid_mode` (String) The process namespace to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are ``host`` or ``task``. On Fargate for Linux containers, the only valid value is ``task``. For example, monitoring sidecars might need ``pidMode`` to access information about other containers running in the same task.
 If ``host`` is specified, all containers within the tasks that specified the ``host`` PID mode on the same container instance share the same process namespace with the host Amazon EC2 instance.
 If ``task`` is specified, all containers within the specified task share the same process namespace.
 If no value is specified, the default is a private namespace for each container. For more information, see [PID settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#pid-settings---pid) in the *Docker run reference*.
 If the ``host`` PID mode is used, there's a heightened risk of undesired process namespace exposure. For more information, see [Docker security](https://doc
- `placement_constraints` (Attributes Set) An array of placement constraint objects to use for tasks.
  This parameter isn't supported for tasks run on FARGATElong. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--placement_constraints))
- `proxy_configuration` (Attributes) The configuration details for the App Mesh proxy.
 Your Amazon ECS container instances require at least version 1.26.0 of the container agent and at least version 1.26.0-1 of the ``ecs-init`` package to use a proxy configuration. If your container instances are launched from the Amazon ECS optimized AMI version ``20190301`` or later, they contain the required versions of the container agent and ``ecs-init``. For more information, see [Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--proxy_configuration))
- `requires_compatibilities` (Set of String) The task launch types the task definition was validated against. The valid values are ``EC2``, ``FARGATE``, and ``EXTERNAL``. For more information, see [Amazon ECS launch types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
- `runtime_platform` (Attributes) The operating system that your tasks definitions run on. A platform family is specified only for tasks using the Fargate launch type. 
 When you specify a task definition in a service, this value must match the ``runtimePlatform`` value of the service. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--runtime_platform))
- `tags` (Attributes List) The metadata that you apply to the task definition to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You define both of them.
 The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
  +  Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
  +  For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
  +  Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
  +  Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
  +  If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
  +  Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
  +  Do not use ``aws:``, ``AWS:``, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
- `task_definition_arn` (String)
- `task_role_arn` (String) The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAMlong role that grants containers in the task permission to call AWS APIs on your behalf. For more information, see [Amazon ECS Task Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
 IAM roles for tasks on Windows require that the ``-EnableTaskIAMRole`` option is set when you launch the Amazon ECS-optimized Windows AMI. Your containers must also run some configuration code to use the feature. For more information, see [Windows IAM roles for tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/windows_task_IAM_roles.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
- `volumes` (Attributes Set) The list of data volume definitions for the task. For more information, see [Using data volumes in tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_data_volumes.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
  The ``host`` and ``sourcePath`` parameters aren't supported for tasks run on FARGATElong. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--volumes))

This parameter maps to ``Cmd`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``COMMAND`` parameter to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration). For more information, see [https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd). If there are multiple arguments, each argument is a separated string in the array.
- `cpu` (Number) The number of ``cpu`` units reserved for the container. This parameter maps to ``CpuShares`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--cpu-shares`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).
 This field is optional for tasks using the Fargate launch type, and the only requirement is that the total amount of CPU reserved for all containers within a task be lower than the task-level ``cpu`` value.
  You can determine the number of CPU units that are available per EC2 instance type by multiplying the vCPUs listed for that instance type on the [Amazon EC2 Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) detail page by 1,024.
  Linux containers share unallocated CPU units with other containers on the cont
- `credential_specs` (List of String) A list of ARNs in SSM or Amazon S3 to a credential spec (``CredSpec``) file that configures the container for Active Directory authentication. We recommend that you use this parameter instead of the ``dockerSecurityOptions``. The maximum number of ARNs is 1.
 There are two formats for each ARN.
  + credentialspecdomainless:MyARN You use credentialspecdomainless:MyARN to provide a CredSpec with an additional section for a secret in . You provide the login credentials to the domain in the secret. Each task that runs on any container instance can join different domains. You can use this format without joining the container instance to a domain. + credentialspec:MyARN You use credentialspec:MyARN to provide a CredSpec for a single domain. You must join the container instance to the domain before you start any tasks that use this task definition. 
 In both formats, replace ``MyARN`` with the ARN in SSM or Amazon S3.
 If you provide a ``credentialspecdomainless:MyARN``, the ``credspec`` must
- `depends_on` (Attributes List) The dependencies defined for container startup and shutdown. A container can contain multiple dependencies. When a dependency is defined for container startup, for container shutdown it is reversed.
 For tasks using the EC2 launch type, the container instances require at least version 1.26.0 of the container agent to turn on container dependencies. However, we recommend using the latest container agent version. For information about checking your agent version and updating to the latest version, see [Updating the Amazon ECS Container Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*. If you're using an Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI, your instance needs at least version 1.26.0-1 of the ``ecs-init`` package. If your container instances are launched from version ``20190301`` or later, then they contain the required versions of the container agent and ``ecs-init``. For more information, see [ (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--container_definitions--depends_on))
- `disable_networking` (Boolean) When this parameter is true, networking is off within the container. This parameter maps to ``NetworkDisabled`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/).
  This parameter is not supported for Windows containers.

  This parameter is not supported for Windows containers.
- `dns_servers` (List of String) A list of DNS servers that are presented to the container. This parameter maps to ``Dns`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--dns`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).
  This parameter is not supported for Windows containers.
- `docker_labels` (Map of String) A key/value map of labels to add to the container. This parameter maps to ``Labels`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--label`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration). This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log in to your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}'``
- `docker_security_options` (List of String) A list of strings to provide custom configuration for multiple security systems. For more information about valid values, see [Docker Run Security Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration). This field isn't valid for containers in tasks using the Fargate launch type.
 For Linux tasks on EC2, this parameter can be used to reference custom labels for SELinux and AppArmor multi-level security systems.
 For any tasks on EC2, this parameter can be used to reference a credential spec file that configures a container for Active Directory authentication. For more information, see [Using gMSAs for Windows Containers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/windows-gmsa.html) and [Using gMSAs for Linux Containers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/linux-gmsa.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
 This parameter maps to ``SecurityOpt`` in the [Create a co
- `entry_point` (List of String) Early versions of the Amazon ECS container agent don't properly handle ``entryPoint`` parameters. If you have problems using ``entryPoint``, update your container agent or enter your commands and arguments as ``command`` array items instead.
  The entry point that's passed to the container. This parameter maps to ``Entrypoint`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--entrypoint`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).

- `environment` (Attributes Set) The environment variables to pass to a container. This parameter maps to ``Env`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--env`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).
  We don't recommend that you use plaintext environment variables for sensitive information, such as credential data. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--container_definitions--environment))
- `environment_files` (Attributes List) A list of files containing the environment variables to pass to a container. This parameter maps to the ``--env-file`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).
 You can specify up to ten environment files. The file must have a ``.env`` file extension. Each line in an environment file contains an environment variable in ``VARIABLE=VALUE`` format. Lines beginning with ``#`` are treated as comments and are ignored. For more information about the environment variable file syntax, see [Declare default environment variables in file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/).
 If there are environment variables specified using the ``environment`` parameter in a container definition, they take precedence over the variables contained within an environment file. If multiple environment files are specified that contain the same variable, they're processed from the top down. We recommend t (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--container_definitions--environment_files))
- `essential` (Boolean) If the ``essential`` parameter of a container is marked as ``true``, and that container fails or stops for any reason, all other containers that are part of the task are stopped. If the ``essential`` parameter of a container is marked as ``false``, its failure doesn't affect the rest of the containers in a task. If this parameter is omitted, a container is assumed to be essential.
 All tasks must have at least one essential container. If you have an application that's composed of multiple containers, group containers that are used for a common purpose into components, and separate the different components into multiple task definitions. For more information, see [Application Architecture](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/application_architecture.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
- `extra_hosts` (Attributes List) A list of hostnames and IP address mappings to append to the ``/etc/hosts`` file on the container.

  This parameter isn't supported for Windows containers or tasks that use the ``awsvpc`` network mode. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--container_definitions--extra_hosts))
- `firelens_configuration` (Attributes) The FireLens configuration for the container. This is used to specify and configure a log router for container logs. For more information, see [Custom Log Routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_firelens.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--container_definitions--firelens_configuration))

  The ``hostname`` parameter is not supported if you're using the ``awsvpc`` network mode.
- `image` (String) The image used to start a container. This string is passed directly to the Docker daemon. By default, images in the Docker Hub registry are available. Other repositories are specified with either ``repository-url/image:tag`` or ``repository-url/image@digest``. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, underscores, colons, periods, forward slashes, and number signs are allowed. This parameter maps to ``Image`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``IMAGE`` parameter of [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).
  +  When a new task starts, the Amazon ECS container agent pulls the latest version of the specified image and tag for the container to use. However, subsequent updates to a repository image
- `interactive` (Boolean) When this parameter is ``true``, you can deploy containerized applications that require ``stdin`` or a ``tty`` to be allocated. This parameter maps to ``OpenStdin`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--interactive`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).
- `links` (Set of String) The ``links`` parameter allows containers to communicate with each other without the need for port mappings. This parameter is only supported if the network mode of a task definition is ``bridge``. The ``name:internalName`` construct is analogous to ``name:alias`` in Docker links. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed. For more information about linking Docker containers, go to [Legacy container links](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/network/links/) in the Docker documentation. This parameter maps to ``Links`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--link`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).

- `linux_parameters` (Attributes) Linux-specific modifications that are applied to the container, such as Linux kernel capabilities. For more information see [KernelCapabilities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_KernelCapabilities.html).
  This parameter is not supported for Windows containers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--container_definitions--linux_parameters))
- `log_configuration` (Attributes) The log configuration specification for the container.
 This parameter maps to ``LogConfig`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--log-driver`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/). By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However, the container may use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see [Configure logging drivers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/htt (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--container_definitions--log_configuration))
- `memory` (Number) The amount (in MiB) of memory to present to the container. If your container attempts to exceed the memory specified here, the container is killed. The total amount of memory reserved for all containers within a task must be lower than the task ``memory`` value, if one is specified. This parameter maps to ``Memory`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--memory`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).
 If using the Fargate launch type, this parameter is optional.
 If using the EC2 launch type, you must specify either a task-level memory value or a container-level memory value. If you specify both a container-level ``memory`` and ``memoryReservation`` value, ``memory`` must be greater than ``memoryReserva
- `memory_reservation` (Number) The soft limit (in MiB) of memory to reserve for the container. When system memory is under heavy contention, Docker attempts to keep the container memory to this soft limit. However, your container can consume more memory when it needs to, up to either the hard limit specified with the ``memory`` parameter (if applicable), or all of the available memory on the container instance, whichever comes first. This parameter maps to ``MemoryReservation`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--memory-reservation`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).
 If a task-level memory value is not specified, you must specify a non-zero integer for one or both of ``memory`` or ``memoryReservation`` in a container definiti
- `mount_points` (Attributes List) The mount points for data volumes in your container.
 This parameter maps to ``Volumes`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--volume`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).
 Windows containers can mount whole directories on the same drive as ``$env:ProgramData``. Windows containers can't mount directories on a different drive, and mount point can't be across drives. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--container_definitions--mount_points))
- `name` (String) The name of a container. If you're linking multiple containers together in a task definition, the ``name`` of one container can be entered in the ``links`` of another container to connect the containers. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed. This parameter maps to ``name`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--name`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).
- `port_mappings` (Attributes Set) The list of port mappings for the container. Port mappings allow containers to access ports on the host container instance to send or receive traffic.
 For task definitions that use the ``awsvpc`` network mode, you should only specify the ``containerPort``. The ``hostPort`` can be left blank or it must be the same value as the ``containerPort``.
 Port mappings on Windows use the ``NetNAT`` gateway address rather than ``localhost``. There is no loopback for port mappings on Windows, so you cannot access a container's mapped port from the host itself. 
 This parameter maps to ``PortBindings`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--publish`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/). If the network mode of a task definition is set to (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--container_definitions--port_mappings))
- `privileged` (Boolean) When this parameter is true, the container is given elevated privileges on the host container instance (similar to the ``root`` user). This parameter maps to ``Privileged`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--privileged`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).
  This parameter is not supported for Windows containers or tasks run on FARGATElong.

- `start_timeout` (Number) Time duration (in seconds) to wait before giving up on resolving dependencies for a container. For example, you specify two containers in a task definition with containerA having a dependency on containerB reaching a ``COMPLETE``, ``SUCCESS``, or ``HEALTHY`` status. If a ``startTimeout`` value is specified for containerB and it doesn't reach the desired status within that time then containerA gives up and not start. This results in the task transitioning to a ``STOPPED`` state.
  When the ``ECS_CONTAINER_START_TIMEOUT`` container agent configuration variable is used, it's enforced independently from this start timeout value.
  For tasks using the Fargate launch type, the task or service requires the following platforms:
  +  Linux platform version ``1.3.0`` or later.
  +  Windows platform version ``1.0.0`` or later.
  
 For tasks using the EC2 launch type, your container instances require at least version ``1.26.0`` of the container agent to use a container start timeout value. However
- `stop_timeout` (Number) Time duration (in seconds) to wait before the container is forcefully killed if it doesn't exit normally on its own.
 For tasks using the Fargate launch type, the task or service requires the following platforms:
  +  Linux platform version ``1.3.0`` or later.
  +  Windows platform version ``1.0.0`` or later.
  
 The max stop timeout value is 120 seconds and if the parameter is not specified, the default value of 30 seconds is used.
 For tasks that use the EC2 launch type, if the ``stopTimeout`` parameter isn't specified, the value set for the Amazon ECS container agent configuration variable ``ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT`` is used. If neither the ``stopTimeout`` parameter or the ``ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT`` agent configuration variable are set, then the default values of 30 seconds for Linux containers and 30 seconds on Windows containers are used. Your container instances require at least version 1.26.0 of the container agent to use a container stop timeout value. However, we recomm
- `system_controls` (Attributes List) A list of namespaced kernel parameters to set in the container. This parameter maps to ``Sysctls`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--sysctl`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration). For example, you can configure ``net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time`` setting to maintain longer lived connections. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--container_definitions--system_controls))
- `ulimits` (Attributes List) A list of ``ulimits`` to set in the container. This parameter maps to ``Ulimits`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--ulimit`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/). Valid naming values are displayed in the [Ulimit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_Ulimit.html) data type. This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log in to your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}'`` 
  This parameter is not supported for Windows containers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--container_definitions--ulimits))
- `user` (String) The user to use inside the container. This parameter maps to ``User`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--user`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).
  When running tasks using the ``host`` network mode, don't run containers using the root user (UID 0). We recommend using a non-root user for better security.
  You can specify the ``user`` using the following formats. If specifying a UID or GID, you must specify it as a positive integer.
  +   ``user`` 
  +   ``user:group`` 
  +   ``uid`` 
  +   ``uid:gid``

  When you use the AWS Management Console JSON panel, the CLIlong, or the APIs, enclose the list of commands in double quotes and brackets.
  ``[ "CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1" ]`` 
 You don't include the double quotes and brackets when you use the AWS Management Console.
  ``CMD-SHELL, curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1`` 
 An exit code of 0 indicates success, and non-zero exit code indicates failure. For more information, see ``HealthCheck`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/).

Read-Only:

- `capabilities` (Attributes) The Linux capabilities for the container that are added to or dropped from the default configuration provided by Docker.
  For tasks that use the Fargate launch type, ``capabilities`` is supported for all platform versions but the ``add`` parameter is only supported if using platform version 1.4.0 or later. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--container_definitions--linux_parameters--capabilities))
- `devices` (Attributes List) Any host devices to expose to the container.

  If you're using tasks that use the Fargate launch type, the ``devices`` parameter isn't supported. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--container_definitions--linux_parameters--devices))
- `init_process_enabled` (Boolean) Run an ``init`` process inside the container that forwards signals and reaps processes. This parameter maps to the ``--init`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration). This parameter requires version 1.25 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log in to your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}'``
- `max_swap` (Number) The total amount of swap memory (in MiB) a container can use. This parameter will be translated to the ``--memory-swap`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration) where the value would be the sum of the container memory plus the ``maxSwap`` value.
 If a ``maxSwap`` value of ``0`` is specified, the container will not use swap. Accepted values are ``0`` or any positive integer. If the ``maxSwap`` parameter is omitted, the container will use the swap configuration for the container instance it is running on. A ``maxSwap`` value must be set for the ``swappiness`` parameter to be used.
  If you're using tasks that use the Fargate launch type, the ``maxSwap`` parameter isn't supported.
 If you're using tasks on Amazon Linux 2023 the ``swappiness`` parameter isn't supported.

  If you are using tasks that use the Fargate launch type, the ``sharedMemorySize`` parameter is not supported.
- `swappiness` (Number) This allows you to tune a container's memory swappiness behavior. A ``swappiness`` value of ``0`` will cause swapping to not happen unless absolutely necessary. A ``swappiness`` value of ``100`` will cause pages to be swapped very aggressively. Accepted values are whole numbers between ``0`` and ``100``. If the ``swappiness`` parameter is not specified, a default value of ``60`` is used. If a value is not specified for ``maxSwap`` then this parameter is ignored. This parameter maps to the ``--memory-swappiness`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).
  If you're using tasks that use the Fargate launch type, the ``swappiness`` parameter isn't supported.

<a id="nestedatt--container_definitions--port_mappings"></a>
### Nested Schema for `container_definitions.port_mappings`

Read-Only:

- `app_protocol` (String) The application protocol that's used for the port mapping. This parameter only applies to Service Connect. We recommend that you set this parameter to be consistent with the protocol that your application uses. If you set this parameter, Amazon ECS adds protocol-specific connection handling to the Service Connect proxy. If you set this parameter, Amazon ECS adds protocol-specific telemetry in the Amazon ECS console and CloudWatch.
 If you don't set a value for this parameter, then TCP is used. However, Amazon ECS doesn't add protocol-specific telemetry for TCP.
  ``appProtocol`` is immutable in a Service Connect service. Updating this field requires a service deletion and redeployment.
 Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS se
- `container_port` (Number) The port number on the container that's bound to the user-specified or automatically assigned host port.
 If you use containers in a task with the ``awsvpc`` or ``host`` network mode, specify the exposed ports using ``containerPort``.
 If you use containers in a task with the ``bridge`` network mode and you specify a container port and not a host port, your container automatically receives a host port in the ephemeral port range. For more information, see ``hostPort``. Port mappings that are automatically assigned in this way do not count toward the 100 reserved ports limit of a container instance.
- `container_port_range` (String) The port number range on the container that's bound to the dynamically mapped host port range. 
 The following rules apply when you specify a ``containerPortRange``:
  +  You must use either the ``bridge`` network mode or the ``awsvpc`` network mode.
  +  This parameter is available for both the EC2 and FARGATElong launch types.
  +  This parameter is available for both the Linux and Windows operating systems.

  +  For containers in a task with the ``awsvpc`` network mode, the ``hostPortRange`` is set to the same value as the ``containerPortRange``. This is a static mapping strategy.
  +  For containers in a task with the ``bridge`` network mode, the Amazon ECS agent finds open host
- `host_port` (Number) The port number on the container instance to reserve for your container.
 If you specify a ``containerPortRange``, leave this field empty and the value of the ``hostPort`` is set as follows:
  +  For containers in a task with the ``awsvpc`` network mode, the ``hostPort`` is set to the same value as the ``containerPort``. This is a static mapping strategy.
  +  For containers in a task with the ``bridge`` network mode, the Amazon ECS agent finds open ports on the host and automatically binds them to the container ports. This is a dynamic mapping strategy.
  
 If you use containers in a task with the ``awsvpc`` or ``host`` network mode, the ``hostPort`` can either be left blank or set to the same value as the ``containerPort``.
 If you use containers in a task with the ``bridge`` network mode, you can specify a non-reserved host port for your container port mapping, or you can omit the ``hostPort`` (or set it to ``0``) while specifying a ``containerPort`` and your container automatically

<a id="nestedatt--volumes"></a>
### Nested Schema for `volumes`

Read-Only:

- `configured_at_launch` (Boolean) Indicates whether the volume should be configured at launch time. This is used to create Amazon EBS volumes for standalone tasks or tasks created as part of a service. Each task definition revision may only have one volume configured at launch in the volume configuration.
 To configure a volume at launch time, use this task definition revision and specify a ``volumeConfigurations`` object when calling the ``CreateService``, ``UpdateService``, ``RunTask`` or ``StartTask`` APIs.
- `docker_volume_configuration` (Attributes) This parameter is specified when you use Docker volumes.
 Windows containers only support the use of the ``local`` driver. To use bind mounts, specify the ``host`` parameter instead.
  Docker volumes aren't supported by tasks run on FARGATElong. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--volumes--docker_volume_configuration))
- `efs_volume_configuration` (Attributes) This parameter is specified when you use an Amazon Elastic File System file system for task storage. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--volumes--efs_volume_configuration))
- `host` (Attributes) This parameter is specified when you use bind mount host volumes. The contents of the ``host`` parameter determine whether your bind mount host volume persists on the host container instance and where it's stored. If the ``host`` parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns a host path for your data volume. However, the data isn't guaranteed to persist after the containers that are associated with it stop running.
 Windows containers can mount whole directories on the same drive as ``$env:ProgramData``. Windows containers can't mount directories on a different drive, and mount point can't be across drives. For example, you can mount ``C:\my\path:C:\my\path`` and ``D:\:D:\``, but not ``D:\my\path:C:\my\path`` or ``D:\:C:\my\path``. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--volumes--host))
- `name` (String) The name of the volume. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed.
 When using a volume configured at launch, the ``name`` is required and must also be specified as the volume name in the ``ServiceVolumeConfiguration`` or ``TaskVolumeConfiguration`` parameter when creating your service or standalone task.
 For all other types of volumes, this name is referenced in the ``sourceVolume`` parameter of the ``mountPoints`` object in the container definition.
 When a volume is using the ``efsVolumeConfiguration``, the name is required.

### Nested Schema for `volumes.docker_volume_configuration`

Read-Only:

- `autoprovision` (Boolean) If this value is ``true``, the Docker volume is created if it doesn't already exist.
  This field is only used if the ``scope`` is ``shared``.
- `driver` (String) The Docker volume driver to use. The driver value must match the driver name provided by Docker because it is used for task placement. If the driver was installed using the Docker plugin CLI, use ``docker plugin ls`` to retrieve the driver name from your container instance. If the driver was installed using another method, use Docker plugin discovery to retrieve the driver name. For more information, see [Docker plugin discovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugin_api/#plugin-discovery). This parameter maps to ``Driver`` in the [Create a volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/VolumeCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``xxdriver`` option to [docker volume create](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/).

This parameter maps to ``DriverOpts`` in the [Create a volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/VolumeCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``xxopt`` option to [docker volume create](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/).
- `labels` (Map of String) Custom metadata to add to your Docker volume. This parameter maps to ``Labels`` in the [Create a volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/VolumeCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``xxlabel`` option to [docker volume create](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/).
- `scope` (String) The scope for the Docker volume that determines its lifecycle. Docker volumes that are scoped to a ``task`` are automatically provisioned when the task starts and destroyed when the task stops. Docker volumes that are scoped as ``shared`` persist after the task stops.

### Nested Schema for `volumes.efs_volume_configuration`

Read-Only:

- `authorization_config` (Attributes) The authorization configuration details for the Amazon EFS file system. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--volumes--efs_volume_configuration--authorization_config))
- `filesystem_id` (String) The Amazon EFS file system ID to use.
- `root_directory` (String) The directory within the Amazon EFS file system to mount as the root directory inside the host. If this parameter is omitted, the root of the Amazon EFS volume will be used. Specifying ``/`` will have the same effect as omitting this parameter.
  If an EFS access point is specified in the ``authorizationConfig``, the root directory parameter must either be omitted or set to ``/`` which will enforce the path set on the EFS access point.
- `transit_encryption` (String) Determines whether to use encryption for Amazon EFS data in transit between the Amazon ECS host and the Amazon EFS server. Transit encryption must be turned on if Amazon EFS IAM authorization is used. If this parameter is omitted, the default value of ``DISABLED`` is used. For more information, see [Encrypting data in transit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/encryption-in-transit.html) in the *Amazon Elastic File System User Guide*.
- `transit_encryption_port` (Number) The port to use when sending encrypted data between the Amazon ECS host and the Amazon EFS server. If you do not specify a transit encryption port, it will use the port selection strategy that the Amazon EFS mount helper uses. For more information, see [EFS mount helper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-mount-helper.html) in the *Amazon Elastic File System User Guide*.

<a id="nestedatt--volumes--efs_volume_configuration--authorization_config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `volumes.efs_volume_configuration.authorization_config`

Read-Only:

- `access_point_id` (String) The Amazon EFS access point ID to use. If an access point is specified, the root directory value specified in the ``EFSVolumeConfiguration`` must either be omitted or set to ``/`` which will enforce the path set on the EFS access point. If an access point is used, transit encryption must be on in the ``EFSVolumeConfiguration``. For more information, see [Working with Amazon EFS access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-access-points.html) in the *Amazon Elastic File System User Guide*.
- `iam` (String) Determines whether to use the Amazon ECS task role defined in a task definition when mounting the Amazon EFS file system. If it is turned on, transit encryption must be turned on in the ``EFSVolumeConfiguration``. If this parameter is omitted, the default value of ``DISABLED`` is used. For more information, see [Using Amazon EFS access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/efs-volumes.html#efs-volume-accesspoints) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.



<a id="nestedatt--volumes--host"></a>
### Nested Schema for `volumes.host`

Read-Only:

- `source_path` (String) When the ``host`` parameter is used, specify a ``sourcePath`` to declare the path on the host container instance that's presented to the container. If this parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon has assigned a host path for you. If the ``host`` parameter contains a ``sourcePath`` file location, then the data volume persists at the specified location on the host container instance until you delete it manually. If the ``sourcePath`` value doesn't exist on the host container instance, the Docker daemon creates it. If the location does exist, the contents of the source path folder are exported.
 If you're using the Fargate launch type, the ``sourcePath`` parameter is not supported.
