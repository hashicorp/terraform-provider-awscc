Data Source schema for AWS::KMS::Alias



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `alias_name` (String) Specifies the alias name. This value must begin with ``alias/`` followed by a name, such as ``alias/ExampleAlias``. 
  If you change the value of the ``AliasName`` property, the existing alias is deleted and a new alias is created for the specified KMS key. This change can disrupt applications that use the alias. It can also allow or deny access to a KMS key affected by attribute-based access control (ABAC).
  The alias must be string of 1-256 characters. It can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). The alias name cannot begin with ``alias/aws/``. The ``alias/aws/`` prefix is reserved for [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk).
- `target_key_id` (String) Associates the alias with the specified [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk). The KMS key must be in the same AWS-account and Region.
 A valid key ID is required. If you supply a null or empty string value, this operation returns an error.
 For help finding the key ID and ARN, see [Finding the key ID and ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/viewing-keys.html#find-cmk-id-arn) in the *Developer Guide*.
 Specify the key ID or the key ARN of the KMS key.
 For example:
  +  Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`` 
  +  Key ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`` 
  
 To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use [ListKeys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_ListKeys.html) or [DescribeKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html).
