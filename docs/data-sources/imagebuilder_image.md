### Nested Schema for `image_pipeline_execution_settings`

Read-Only:

- `deployment_id` (String) The deployment ID of the pipeline, used to trigger new image pipeline executions.
- `on_update` (Boolean) Whether to trigger the image pipeline when the pipeline is updated. False by default.


<a id="nestedatt--image_scanning_configuration"></a>
### Nested Schema for `image_scanning_configuration`

Read-Only:

- `ecr_configuration` (Attributes) Contains ECR settings for vulnerability scans. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--image_scanning_configuration--ecr_configuration))
