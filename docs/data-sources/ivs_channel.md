## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `arn` (String) Channel ARN is automatically generated on creation and assigned as the unique identifier.
- `authorized` (Boolean) Whether the channel is authorized.
- `ingest_endpoint` (String) Channel ingest endpoint, part of the definition of an ingest server, used when you set up streaming software.
- `insecure_ingest` (Boolean) Whether the channel allows insecure ingest.
- `latency_mode` (String) Channel latency mode.
- `name` (String) Channel
- `playback_url` (String) Channel Playback URL.
- `preset` (String) Optional transcode preset for the channel. This is selectable only for ADVANCED_HD and ADVANCED_SD channel types. For those channel types, the default preset is HIGHER_BANDWIDTH_DELIVERY. For other channel types (BASIC and STANDARD), preset is the empty string ("").
- `recording_configuration_arn` (String) Recording Configuration ARN. A value other than an empty string indicates that recording is enabled. Default: "" (recording is disabled).
- `tags` (Attributes Set) A list of key-value pairs that contain metadata for the asset model. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
- `type` (String) Channel type, which determines the allowable resolution and bitrate. If you exceed the allowable resolution or bitrate, the stream probably will disconnect immediately.
