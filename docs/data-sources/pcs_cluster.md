<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `arn` (String) The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster.
- `cluster_id` (String) The generated unique ID of the cluster.
- `endpoints` (Attributes List) The list of endpoints available for interaction with the scheduler. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--endpoints))
- `error_info` (Attributes List) The list of errors that occurred during cluster provisioning. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--error_info))
- `name` (String) The name that identifies the cluster.
- `networking` (Attributes) The networking configuration for the cluster's control plane. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--networking))
- `scheduler` (Attributes) The cluster management and job scheduling software associated with the cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--scheduler))
- `size` (String) The size of the cluster.
- `slurm_configuration` (Attributes) Additional options related to the Slurm scheduler. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--slurm_configuration))
- `status` (String) The provisioning status of the cluster. The provisioning status doesn't indicate the overall health of the cluster.
- `tags` (Map of String) 1 or more tags added to the resource. Each tag consists of a tag key and tag value. The tag value is optional and can be an empty string.
