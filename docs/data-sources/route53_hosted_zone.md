# awscc_route53_hosted_zone (Data Source)

Data Source schema for AWS::Route53::HostedZone



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- **id** (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- **hosted_zone_config** (Attributes) A complex type that contains an optional comment.

If you don't want to specify a comment, omit the HostedZoneConfig and Comment elements. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--hosted_zone_config))
- **hosted_zone_tags** (Attributes Set) Adds, edits, or deletes tags for a health check or a hosted zone.

For information about using tags for cost allocation, see Using Cost Allocation Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--hosted_zone_tags))
- **name** (String) The name of the domain. Specify a fully qualified domain name, for example, www.example.com. The trailing dot is optional; Amazon Route 53 assumes that the domain name is fully qualified. This means that Route 53 treats www.example.com (without a trailing dot) and www.example.com. (with a trailing dot) as identical.

If you're creating a public hosted zone, this is the name you have registered with your DNS registrar. If your domain name is registered with a registrar other than Route 53, change the name servers for your domain to the set of NameServers that are returned by the Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function.
- **name_servers** (List of String)
- **query_logging_config** (Attributes) A complex type that contains information about a configuration for DNS query logging. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--query_logging_config))
- **vp_cs** (Attributes Set) A complex type that contains information about the VPCs that are associated with the specified hosted zone. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--vp_cs))
