## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

- `bundle_id` (String) The bundle ID to use for the distribution.
- `cache_behavior_settings` (Attributes) An object that describes the cache behavior settings for the distribution. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cache_behavior_settings))
- `cache_behaviors` (Attributes Set) An array of objects that describe the per-path cache behavior for the distribution. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cache_behaviors))
- `certificate_name` (String) The certificate attached to the Distribution.
- `default_cache_behavior` (Attributes) An object that describes the default cache behavior for the distribution. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--default_cache_behavior))
- `distribution_arn` (String)
- `distribution_name` (String) The name for the distribution.
- `ip_address_type` (String) The IP address type for the distribution.
- `is_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether the distribution is enabled.
- `origin` (Attributes) An object that describes the origin resource for the distribution, such as a Lightsail instance or load balancer. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--origin))

Read-Only:

- `allowed_http_methods` (String) The HTTP methods that are processed and forwarded to the distribution's origin.
- `cached_http_methods` (String) The HTTP method responses that are cached by your distribution.
- `default_ttl` (Number) The default amount of time that objects stay in the distribution's cache before the distribution forwards another request to the origin to determine whether the content has been updated.

- `maximum_ttl` (Number) The maximum amount of time that objects stay in the distribution's cache before the distribution forwards another request to the origin to determine whether the object has been updated.
- `minimum_ttl` (Number) The minimum amount of time that objects stay in the distribution's cache before the distribution forwards another request to the origin to determine whether the object has been updated.
