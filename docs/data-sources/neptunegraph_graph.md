Data Source schema for AWS::NeptuneGraph::Graph



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `deletion_protection` (Boolean) Value that indicates whether the Graph has deletion protection enabled. The graph can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled.

_Default_: If not specified, the default value is true.
- `endpoint` (String) The connection endpoint for the graph. For example: `g-12a3bcdef4.us-east-1.neptune-graph.amazonaws.com`
- `graph_arn` (String) Graph resource ARN
- `graph_id` (String) The auto-generated id assigned by the service.
- `graph_name` (String) Contains a user-supplied name for the Graph. 

If you don't specify a name, we generate a unique Graph Name using a combination of Stack Name and a UUID comprising of 4 characters.

_Important_: If you specify a name, you cannot perform updates that require replacement of this resource. You can perform updates that require no or some interruption. If you must replace the resource, specify a new name.
- `provisioned_memory` (Number) Memory for the Graph.
- `public_connectivity` (Boolean) Specifies whether the Graph can be reached over the internet. Access to all graphs requires IAM authentication.

When the Graph is publicly reachable, its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP address from the internet.

When the Graph isn't publicly reachable, you need to create a PrivateGraphEndpoint in a given VPC to ensure the DNS name resolves to a private IP address that is reachable from the VPC.

_Default_: If not specified, the default value is false.
- `replica_count` (Number) Specifies the number of replicas you want when finished. All replicas will be provisioned in different availability zones.

Replica Count should always be less than or equal to 2.

_Default_: If not specified, the default value is 1.
- `tags` (Attributes Set) The tags associated with this graph. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
- `vector_search_configuration` (Attributes) Vector Search Configuration (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--vector_search_configuration))
