# Contributing to Terraform - AWS Cloud Control Provider

**First:** if you're unsure or afraid of _anything_, ask for help! You can
submit a work in progress (WIP) pull request, or file an issue with the parts
you know. We'll do our best to guide you in the right direction, and let you
know if there are guidelines we will need to follow. We want people to be able
to participate without fear of doing the wrong thing.
