## Example Usage

**IMPORTANT:** Amazon GameLift Game Server Groups can take some time to finish activating. This can lead to a long-running (>25min) `terraform apply` and is normal. 
If you encounter errors with your game server group not activating successfully, check the troubleshooting steps listed in 
[this doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-lifecycle.html#gsg-howitworks-lifecycle-gameservergroup) as well as the required IAM cross-account 
roles [documented here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-iam-permissions-roles.html).

To use {{.Name}} to create a GameLift FleetIQ Game Server Group:
{{ tffile (printf "examples/resources/%s/gamelift_game_server_group.tf" .Name)}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}
{{- if .HasImport }}

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

{{ codefile "shell" .ImportFile }}

{{- end }}
