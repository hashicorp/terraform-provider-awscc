## Example Usage

### Basic usage with Python platform

In this example, we create an AWS Elastic Beanstalk configuration template using the Python platform, a t3 medium instance and an Immutable deployment policy. This example assumes that you have deployed an environment with high availability and that you are using a dedicated Application Load Balancer. Please refer to [Python platform history](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/platforms/platform-history-python.html) and use the current platform version and solution stack name. Replace the `example-aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role` with your existing [instance profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/iam-instanceprofile.html).
