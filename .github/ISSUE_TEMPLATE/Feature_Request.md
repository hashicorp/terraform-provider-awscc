* The resources and data sources in this provider are generated from the CloudFormation schema, so they can only support the actions that the underlying schema supports. For this reason submitted bugs should be limited to defects in the generation and runtime code of the provider. Customizing behavior of the resource, or noting a gap in behavior are not valid bugs and should be submitted as enhancements to AWS via the CloudFormation Open Coverage Roadmap.
